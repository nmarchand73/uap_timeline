Foreword 

by Senator Harry Reid

People often ask me how I got interested in what the U.S. government now generally refers to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), but what most people simply called UFOs or flying saucers. I don’t know why, frankly, but I think that perhaps there is something about Nevada that led me on this venture. I am not from the part of Nevada most people think of—Las Vegas. I am from a tiny town in the high desert called Searchlight, with a population of about three hundred. I grew up in a house made of railroad ties and learned to swim in the only pool, which was at a brothel. With mining gone, prostitution was the only industry in town.

When you live in rural America, far away from the bright lights of Boston, Denver, Dallas, Salt Lake City, and Las Vegas, you have the opportunity to look up at a clear night’s sky and see the Milky Way. There’s too much light pollution in the big cities for anyone to catch a glimpse of this nighttime marvel. 

For as long as I remember, my family had a mattress that we kept in the backyard. I spent countless nights outside with my mom, dad, and brothers, gazing up at the endless, starry heavens. It was a rare night that I didn’t see shooting stars. The expanse of stars filled my eyes and sparked my imagination. 

One evening, when I was looking up at the miraculous sky, I asked my dad how many stars there are. He told me there were hundreds of thousands of stars. I laid there in awe and amazement. As an adult, I learned there are an estimated one hundred billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The numbers were vast, but my intrigue was the same. 

As an adult, I’ve always been troubled by the fact that I have no background in science. In my elementary school, we didn’t have a science teacher; there was only one teacher who taught all eight grades. In high school, the only course that was remotely close to science was geometry. In college, I double-majored in political science and history, and then, I earned a law degree.

Despite my lack of scientific knowledge, or perhaps because of it, I have always been fascinated by things I don’t understand—by the mysterious and the unexplained. Why does the Sun stay hot? I wondered as a boy. Why doesn’t it cool down at the end of the day? Albert Einstein once said: “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity.”

As a young man I may not have found the answers (or at least the right answers), but I never stopped asking questions. From the quiet nights I spent in rural Nevada staring up at the sky and the wonders it contained to exploring the enigmas of the present day, I’ve never lost a holy curiosity.

That’s why my curiosity was piqued when my friend George Knapp, an investigative reporter and news anchor at KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, reached out to me in 1989 about a story he was working on linking Area 51 to UFOs. Long before George approached me about his investigation, the highly classified U.S. Air Force facility called Area 51 had gained a reputation for the mystique. 

When I was a boy, stories swirled about the government effectively seizing a mining property in Lincoln County, 120 miles north of Las Vegas that the Sheahan family had called home since 1889. Groom Mine is nestled on a mountainside overlooking a desolate, long-dry lake bed known as Groom Lake. The family was left alone to mine silver, lead, zinc, and copper until the 1940s when the government established a military base six miles away from their homestead. This base would become known as Area 51. 

The Sheahans endured years of military training flights for aerial gunnery and bombing practice. Stray bullets narrowly missed children playing outside their home. An aerial bombardment caused an inferno that devastated their mill. When the Atomic Energy Commission began nuclear testing twenty miles southwest of their home, the family was blasted with hot metal pellets and other debris raining down from nuclear fallout.

By 1959, the Sheahans were broke and realized the U.S. Air Force was never going to pay them to repair the damage done to their mill. They moved to Las Vegas. Once the place where they lived and worked, Groom Mine became a respite that family members would visit on weekends to tell stories, barbeque, and target practice. But that all ended one weekend in 1978, when the Sheahan brothers arrived at their property to find it was fenced off by the U.S. military. The armed federal agents told them, “you can’t come here anymore.”

When George reached out to me about his Area 51 story, I couldn’t help but think of the Sheahan family. I agreed to do some investigating on the matter and did a live interview with George from Washington, D.C. Since then, he and I have kept in touch swapping stories, and George has steadfastly reported on the subject. He is a co-author of this book. That exemplifies how George has earned a well-deserved reputation as a subject matter expert as well as an award-winning journalist when it comes to UAPs and related phenomena.

One day in 1996, I received a call from George. “Harry,” he said, “there’s something you should attend.” He invited me to attend a National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) event and connected me with NIDS’s founder Las Vegas businessman Robert “Bob” Bigelow. I had first heard of Bob when I was a lawyer working on a case where a plane taking off had crashed and killed everyone on plane. One of the people killed was Bob’s dad. 

Bob and I talked about our mutual interest, and eventually I was able to attend a NIDS board meeting later that year. The meeting was held large conference room filled with prestigious academics, former U.S. senators, interested members of the public, and a few oddballs. This is where I first met Dr. Colm Kelleher. Speaking about NIDS, Dr. Kelleher has aptly said, “We don’t study aliens, we study anomalies. They’re the same things in a lot of people’s minds, but not our minds.” That’s how I feel about UAPs.

I was very impressed with the academics who talked science, discussing the issue of UAPs in terms of technological advancement and national security. My time at this event forever cemented my interest in UFOs.

Serving in the U.S. Senate allowed me to befriend John Glenn, a Marine combat aviator in Korea and Vietnam, astronaut, engineer, and fellow senator. On more than one occasion, I conversed with him about UAPs. This brilliant and distinguished American hero believed that we needed to know more about the subject. I agreed.

As I became increasingly interested in UAPs, my staff warned me not to engage. “Stay the hell away from this,” they said. But I couldn’t help it—I was curious. I thought it was something that deserved an honest look and I found myself in a position to do something about it. So, I politely ignored my staff and decided to act.

In 2007, I received a telephone call from Bob Bigelow regarding a letter he had received from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). He wanted me to look at the letter. The letter stated that this man from the DIA wanted permission to visit Bob about a number of things, including being able to visit his property in Utah known as Skinwalker Ranch. I learned that the letter was written by a man from the DIA who was a physicist: Dr. Jim Lacatski. 

Neither of us wanted to meet in our offices, so Dr. Lacatski came to my home where he told me he was an expert in rockets. He explained that he knew how rockets got started, how they functioned currently, and what the future of rocketry will be. Dr. Lacatski said, however, that he did not understand why UAPs appeared to be ignored by the scientific community. He also wanted to study the phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch.

I was convinced Dr. Lacatski was on to something. Recalling the 1996 NIDS conference and my conversations with American hero John Glenn, I believed the time to focus on UAPs and related phenomena in the context of science was now.

As the United States Senate Majority Leader, I decided to meet in a classified location in the United States Capitol with two key members of the appropriations process. The two members of the Appropriations Committee who controlled the dark money, the non-public money, were Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Democratic Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii. 

After explaining what I wanted, Senator Stevens recounted a story from when he was a pilot during World War II. He told us that during one flight, he had seen something off his wing that he could not identify; it moved in ways he did not think were possible. He was low on fuel, and upon landing he asked the crew on the ground what that was up there with him. They looked at him askance and told him they had seen nothing up there except his airplane. At the time, he let the matter drop because he didn’t want to be pegged as seeing things. But the experience always nagged at him. Because of his prior experience, he told Senator Inouye and me that he was happy to secure funding to study UAPs and related phenomena. 

Thus, the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) was conceived. Senators Stevens, Inouye, and I decided to allocate $22 million to get the program started. A government request for proposal was put out, and Bob Bigelow’s company secured the bid. 

When I first reached out to my Senate colleagues on UAPs, I wanted to find out if there was anything to these sightings. New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said, “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” Through AAWSAP, we discovered that there weren’t tens, or hundreds, of people who have credibly witnessed UAPs, there have been thousands.

The history of the UAP study Senators Stevens, Inouye, and I supported was largely unknown until one day a reporter called me from The New York Times. I was hesitant to talk about it. I had recently retired from the Senate, and there was still a stigma attached to the issue—“little green men” and all that. But it became clear to me that the reporter was interested in this as a substantive issue and focused on the science. So, I decided to tell her what I knew.

On December 16, 2017, The New York Times published “Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O. Program.” It was a hit. I immediately started to get dozens of interview requests. Strangers in elevators and friends, including current members of U.S. Congress, thanked me for looking into UAPs. Within a few months, even my wife, Landra, turned to me and said, “you’re not looking so crazy after all.” The media and public interest haven’t let up since; a week doesn’t go by without someone reaching out to me about UAPs. 

The December 2017 story has done a tremendous amount of good, including prompting the U.S. Navy to create a formal system for pilots to report UAP sightings, shattering years of stigma and denial. But unfortunately, it has also muddied the waters. The article correctly identified that the $22 million Senators Stevens and Inouye and I secured went to Bigelow Aerospace Advance Space Studies (BAASS), but it left the government’s AAWSAP program completely out of the narrative. The story merged the original AAWSAP program with the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a program that also investigated UAPs but in the context of the U.S. military. Skinwalkers at the Pentagon: An Insiders’ Account of the Government’s Secret UFO Program provides a full picture of the purview of and accomplishments achieved by the AAWSAP program. Readers will be amazed, enthralled, and I hope that interest in studying UAPs and related phenomena will be increased.

Regardless of when AAWSAP ended or when AATIP began, the facts are undeniable. Data on UAPs exist; they need to be analyzed; more data needs to be collected; and the public should be informed as much as possible. The confusion over these two programs also underscores why the U.S. government needs to establish and fully fund a centralized and coordinated effort focusing on the scientific, technological, and national security implications of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

I commend Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia for leading the Senate Intelligence Committee’s June 2020 authorization to create a UAP Task Force within the Pentagon. The task force was required to submit an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by UAPs and the progress the task force has made in understanding the threat to Congress and the U.S. public within 180 days. 

Meeting its deadline, the UAP Task Force released a report on June 25, 2021, confirming that the U.S. government acknowledges UAPs exist. The authors examined 144 UAP reports from U.S. military personnel since 2004 and only found one instance where they could identify the UAP with high confidence (a large, deflating balloon). The rest of the 143 reports were unidentified. But this is a drop in the bucket. We all know there have been a lot more sightings than the ones they looked at—we have military and civilian UAP reports in the U.S. dating back over 70 years as well as reports from all over the world.

The UAP Task Force report proves what I have been saying all along: this is a matter of science, national security, and technological advancement. From whatever hypothesis you begin with—UAPs being technological leaps from foreign adversaries, natural occurrences distorting visual perception, visitations from other dimensions, or technology from otherworldly sources—the key point is we need to engage the best minds in science to explore the data we know exists. In his book Extraterrestrial, Harvard physicist Avi Loeb says, “No one gets to invent new evidence, no one gets to ignore evidence that is at odds with a hypothesis, and no one gets to—as in the old cartoon of a scientist working through a complex equation—insert ‘and then a miracle happens.’”

Some of the scientific findings you will read in this book may be hard for you to accept or comprehend. I don’t understand some of the science or know what to make of the paranormal occurrences. The more we learn about UAPs, the more we don’t know. That is the key to it all. The U.S. government, academics, and industry leaders need to research UAPs and related phenomena. They also need to keep the public informed, which is why journalists like George Knapp reporting on the subject also play a vital role in fostering transparency. The American people can handle the truth. 

Our universe is vast. Science tells us that there are 500 million planets inside our galaxy that could potentially support life—that’s just in the Milky Way. Many have asked me, “what if research shows UAPs are coming from someplace else?” My response continues to be, “so what?” People used to believe that the Earth is flat, bloodletting is a panacea, climate change is fake, the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax, and UAPs are delusions to be ignored. Science has proven otherwise. 

I believe in science. Powerful countries like China, Russia, and France are studying UAP encounters. The United States should be at the forefront of these global efforts. Focusing on little green men, conspiracy theories, or dismissing UAPs as kooky phenomena from the realm of science fiction won’t get us far. Neither will having the UAP Task Force’s report be the end of the U.S. government’s investigations into UAPs. We need to have our country’s best and brightest minds focused on researching these incredible phenomena. And we need to establish a permanent and funded office to focus on UAPs.

I also believe in transparency. Elected officials and bureaucrats shouldn’t be hiding things from the public. Of course, there are certain things that are sensitive in nature and that’s why we have intelligence agencies. Area 51 was developed at the height of the Cold War, but its existence wasn’t publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government until 2013. To do so earlier would have been detrimental to our security as a nation. 

In a functioning democracy, we must constantly balance the competing priorities of government secrecy and transparency. I believe that there is information uncovered by the government’s covert investigations into UAPs that can be disclosed to the public without harming our national security. The American people deserve to know more, and Skinwalkers at the Pentagon: An Insiders’ Account of the Government’s Secret UFO Program is an excellent start. 

Transparency is the best medicine for good government. We’ve made progress, but there’s more work to be done.

Introduction

On June 25, 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) delivered an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), otherwise known as UFOs, to astonished American and global publics. In the report, the ODNI bluntly reported that “UAP clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to national security.” 

Long time UFO investigator Barry Greenwood fully recognized how the UAP Task Force (UAPTF) Report represented a complete 180-degree turnaround for the United States Government to actually admit the existence of UAPs. “Remember the days,” says Greenwood, “when the US Government explained away UFO sightings as hoaxes, delusions, [and] witnesses being labeled drunks and mentally defective?”1

The public is entitled to ask: what was the genesis of the UAPTF Report? Why did the United States Government suddenly do such an abrupt about face from labelling eyewitnesses as drunks and mental defectives to taking the topic seriously? To answer that question, we must go back 13 years to the year 2008. 

This book describes the first steps on this 13-year rocky road that culminated in the release of the UAPTF Report in June 2021. It describes the genesis and execution of a unique program run (2008–2010) from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States that was the first official, fully funded study of UAPs since the termination in 1969 of the infamous Project Bluebook, which was run by the United States Air Force. 

The name of this covert two-year $22 million DIA program was Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP).

As the public is now fully aware, the United States Government has steadfastly denied any interest in, or work on, UAPs for more than 50 years. Beginning with the publication of an article in The New York Times in December 2017, the world now knows that these denials were not factual. 

There were two remarkable things about AAWSAP. The first was that it existed at all. Between September 2008 and December 2010, the Pentagon spent those millions investigating UAPs as well as the paranormal and psychic correlates to UAPs. 

The second remarkable feature that has been secret until the publication of this book was the breadth and scope of AAWSAP. The details of dozens of controversial projects that comprised this large program are now revealed for the first time in these pages. 

As of late 2021, the plethora of now-familiar stories in mainstream newspapers and TV shows, including the venerable 60 Minutes newsmagazine, have all treated the UAP topic seriously for the first time in decades. However, the media has focused exclusively on the tiny number of UAP events involving interactions with military pilots and military ships. As this book describes for the first time, the scope of the AAWSAP investigations at DIA, which were run by Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), was much broader and delved deeply into the psychic and paranormal relationships to UAP interactions. As Appendix I in this book lays out in full detail, an enormous body of data concerning the psychic and paranormal connections to UAP interactions currently exists at the Defense Intelligence Agency. 

Shortly after the contract award, AAWSAP personnel chose to launch the UAP program with as broad a scope as possible. The decision to research paranormal phenomena that co-locate with UAPs and to examine psychic effects in UAP witnesses in addition to scrutinizing the core UAP technology itself was not taken lightly because of the controversial nature of the UAP-paranormal debate. A significant constituency existed both inside and outside DIA that argued AAWSAP should only focus on researching the technology of UAPs.

We were very fortunate that the AAWSAP program management at DIA agreed to the expansive scope of the program since it meant that a much broader perspective of UAP was integrated into every aspect of AAWSAP investigation from the very beginning.

The logic behind adopting this strategy came from many years of boots-on-the-ground experience in investigating the UAP at Robert T. Bigelow’s National Institute of Discovery Science (NIDS) as well as decades of experience of AAWSAP advisers investigating UAPs. Much of this logic is also written into a seminal paper on UFOs and incommensurability, written by Dr. Jacques Vallee and Dr. Eric Davis.2

After about 14 months of carefully reviewing this manuscript before going to press, the Pentagon officially cleared the contents of this book for publication. The Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR) sent this book out to several cognizant government departments and agencies before being cleared by the Pentagon, provided several changes were made. One of the important changes mandated by the Pentagon is that the names of active duty and other players must be changed, and we have done so. But the authors have retained the names of some senior participants, since the majority have now retired from government service. 

Secondly, because some of the cases that are discussed in this book are medically sensitive and because we must conform to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, the identities of the participants and of the AAWSAP medical consultants in these cases have been obscured. 

What AAWSAP Was and Wasn’t

AAWSAP was conceived as a program to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs. BAASS was an organization specifically created to execute the AAWSAP contract to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs. Throughout this book, “AAWSAP”, “BAASS” and “AAWSAP BAASS” are used interchangeably to denote close operational similarity.

AAWSAP was not conceived to study projected advances in aerospace technology, except in relation to UAPs. 

From the beginning AAWSAP was determined to cast as wide a net as possible to study all phenomena within the overall rubric of the UAP topic. That meant that if paranormal phenomena were known to collocate with, and overlap temporally with, UAPs, then paranormal phenomena would also be studied by AAWSAP. The philosophy of AAWSAP was to study all phenomena observed in relation to UAPs. 

Since the publication of the December 2017 article in The New York Times on “Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious U.F.O. Program,” there has been a multi-year frenzy of speculation, misinformation, and confusion about the nature of the program.

AAWSAP Was Not AATIP

This book is written by the two program managers, Drs. James T. Lacatski and Colm A. Kelleher, who oversaw the day-to-day operations of the AAWSAP BAASS program and is an attempt to correct the record and present scientific data reinforcing the need to explore UAPs and related phenomena. George Knapp, who is arguably the premier journalistic authority in the world on this program, contributed significantly to the book. 

AAWSAP BAASS was not AATIP. The AATIP moniker arose from an unclassified nickname that was inserted into a letter that was sent from Senator Harry Reid to the Deputy Secretary of Defense requesting the creation of a Special Access Program (SAP). This letter is described fully in Chapter 10. Because Lacatski, the DIA program manager, wished to protect the AAWSAP name for security reasons, AATIP was a “made up” substitute name for Reid’s letter to describe the AAWSAP. 

After AAWSAP had shut down, the AATIP designation was used to describe a completely separate, small initiative that was underway at the Pentagon to study UAPs encountered by military personnel. AATIP involved a small group of people working on the UAP problem, with direct knowledge of their superiors, when their day jobs allowed them to. 

The New York Times article created enormous confusion by mistakenly linking the $22 million funding to the small informal AATIP initiative. The $22 million was specifically targeted only to AAWSAP. AATIP, as used by The New York Times was not AAWSAP, and AAWSAP was not AATIP. The $22 million was contracted through the Defense Intelligence Agency into AAWSAP to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs. Not a dollar of that sum went to AATIP despite widespread statements over the last several years. 

Background

James T. Lacatski was the primary creator of AAWSAP, as we detail in this book. Once the program had been down selected from the response to the Request for Proposals (RFP), Lacatski became the DIA program manager, contracting officer representative (COR), security coordinator, and counterintelligence coordinator of this multi-year, multi-million-dollar DIA contract. 

Lacatski used Congressional interest from bipartisan Senate leadership and the assistance of two DIA Directors to obtain multiple years of funding directed to the DIA Directorate of Analysis, specifically the Defense Warning Office (DWO). 

Lacatski then developed the strategic guidance and architecture for a new contractor support effort, and with the concurrence of the DIA Directorate of Finance, wrote a small-business set-aside solicitation (HHM402-08-R-0211) using the then-new statement-of-objectives format. It was issued on August 18, 2008, on the Federal Business Opportunities (Fed Biz Opps) website, with a proposal due date of September 10, 2008. Twelve days later, a contract (HHM402-08-C-0072) was awarded to the sole bidder, Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), for an initial duration of two years.

AAWSAP Objectives

As the small business set aside on Fed Biz Opps stated: “One aspect of the future threat environment involves advanced aerospace weapon system applications. The objective of this program is to understand the physics and engineering of these applications as they apply to the foreign threat out to the far term, i.e., from now through the year 2050. Primary focus is on breakthrough technologies and applications that create discontinuities in currently evolving technology trends. The focus is not on extrapolations of current aerospace technology.” 

The intent of the language crafted was totally directed towards a study on UAPs. There was no ambiguity here. All study of advanced aerospace technology during the AAWSAP was conducted under the rubric of UAPs.

Finally, “the sting is in the tail” of this book: If any reader doubts that the AAWSAP had a much broader scope than the Pentagon’s AATIP program described to date in the media, they only have to turn to Appendix I to peruse the titles of the 109 reports and databases that were delivered to, and currently reside with, the Defense Intelligence Agency of the United States. 

What Is Skinwalker Ranch and How Is It Connected   
to AAWSAP?

Since 1994, the 500-acre property known as Skinwalker Ranch located in northeastern Utah has been continuously studied by humans and sensors. Metallic UAPs, flying orbs of varying colors, otherworldly creatures, discarnate voices, poltergeist, electromagnetic anomalies, and orange “portals” have co-located as well as materialized separately on the property. These extraordinary phenomena have been witnessed by scores of independent visitors to the ranch almost continuously between 1994 and 2021. Additional details on the background of Skinwalker Ranch are summarized in Appendix IV.

Skinwalker Ranch became famous almost overnight after the publication of Hunt for the Skinwalker3 about the scientific research conducted between 1996-2002 on these anomalies by Colm Kelleher, Eric Davis, and George Onet of Robert Bigelow’s NIDS organization. 

James Lacatski and Jonathan Axelrod are two of the primary characters in this book and both had read Hunt for the Skinwalker by 2007. In turn, as described in detail in Chapter 5, the book was the major stimulus for Lacatski contacting Bigelow in July 2007 and subsequently visiting the ranch. The rest, as they say, is history.

Thus, an eerie cause-and-effect lineage exists beginning in 1996 with NIDS’s research forays onto Skinwalker Ranch, Lacatski and Axelrod reading Hunt for the Skinwalker in 2007, continuing through the creation of AAWSAP in 2008, then of AATIP years later, and eventually to the UAPTF in 2018. Like a creepy miasma, Skinwalker Ranch lurked behind the creation of these organizations, and its baleful influence was felt by their most important participants.

Chapter 1: July 2009

There are some things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that cannot be explained, things that most people don’t want to know about. That is where we come in.

— Bill Murray, Ghostbusters II

  


The sun had almost completely set behind Skinwalker Ridge as the three comrades set off on their walk towards the west end of the ranch. They were in high spirits as they sauntered along the dusty trail, joking about some of their past missions and reminiscing about what had brought them to this strange place. They had flown from the East Coast the previous day and were on Skinwalker Ranch in Utah at the invitation of Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS). All three were seasoned warriors who had spent time in the war torn reaches of Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Jonathan Axelrod was the acknowledged leader of the trio. A senior aerospace engineer in Naval Intelligence, his career had already spanned an upward trajectory, and his calm demeanor and infectious sense of humor enabled him to move easily in Pentagon circles. That same year, 2009, Axelrod was also the lead investigator of the now infamous “Tic Tac” case that had embroiled the Nimitz Aircraft Carrier Strike Group in a series of cat and mouse high stakes games off the coast of San Diego a few years previously. The so-called Tic Tac had out-maneuvered and out-performed multiple F/A-18 Hornets, leaving these top gun fighters from the Nimitz in the dust. Axelrod had personally interviewed all the pilots involved in the incident as well as the several radar operators on the USS Princeton and others on the USS Nimitz itself. 

At the time of Axelrod’s arrival at Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, he had not yet completed the sub rosa Nimitz investigation. He had no inkling that his covert UAP investigation would explode onto the front page of The New York Times in December 2017. Axelrod was well versed in investigating anomalies, utilizing a thoroughly professional approach. His demeanor instantly put skittish military aviators at ease; he reassured them that there would be no negative career consequences for their testimony. Axelrod was, and is, the consummate military professional, but on that serene evening on Skinwalker Ranch he had no idea what he was about to run into. 

Darkness had now settled in on the ranch. When Axelrod playfully pushed his best friend, Jim Costigan, away from him, Jim staggered slightly and almost dropped the night vision scope he had been using. Costigan cursed his friend humorously. Costigan was a Marine, had served in Afghanistan on a few hairy missions with Axelrod, and they knew each other very well. 

After a few more minutes adjusting the optics, Costigan finally got the Generation III ITT night vision scope to work to his satisfaction and silently handed it to David Wilson to check out the now dark surroundings. Wilson, tall and lanky, was the most taciturn of the trio. His Marine background had crossed paths with Costigan on numerous overseas missions, and both were experts in the field applications of a wide variety of sensor technology. 

One of the reasons the trio had been invited as Subject Matter Expert consultants onto the Skinwalker property was to begin applying their sensor expertise in tracking the mysterious presence that had out-smarted dozens, even scores, of witnesses over the previous decades. Skinwalker Ranch had gained in notoriety over the years since the 2005 publication of the book Hunt for the Skinwalker, which was the first definitive account of one of the most intensive scientific studies of anomalous phenomena in history.

Axelrod, Costigan, and Wilson all had read the book. They were straight military men; they were open minded but skeptical of the reports from the ranch. Axelrod had once casually mentioned that the Skinwalker book was one of the favorites for military and intelligence community folk as they relaxed around the pool in the Green Zone in Baghdad during the Iraq War. 

All three were seasoned operatives who were equally comfortable out in the field or in briefing rooms in the Pentagon. On that warm July night in 2009, as they strode confidently on the track leading west on the ranch, they were already scoping out the Badlands terrain for places to deploy their technological assets. 

About a half a mile into their hike, the temperature suddenly dropped like a stone. From 75 degrees, the air was now 20 degrees colder. All three stopped and silently looked at each other. There was no wind blowing, the air was still, and the zone they were standing in gave them a deep chill. Axelrod silently raised his hand and motioned backwards. All three walked backwards and within a couple of yards, the temperature had gone back to high 70s. Axelrod motioned forward and the three moved silently in unison. Again, they walked into a wall of coldness. “Weather front?” muttered Costigan. “Probably,” answered Axelrod, and again the trio retreated. Again, they exited the wall of chilled air into the warm night. Three times they repeated the maneuver and three times the sharp boundary that defined the wall of cold air remained in the same location.

“Let’s move on,” Axelrod said, and the trio resumed their journey west. Costigan began scanning the environment, and all around him the bleak badlands landscape looked eerie in night vision green. Thirty yards further on, all three began to feel anxious, and as they walked further, the anxiety deepened and turned into fear. No one said anything; they continued on their journey. But every step they took, their fear seemed to escalate. There was no external reason. No one wanted to be the first to mention the alarm they felt. Ten yards further on, the fear had escalated to mortal fear, and eventually Axelrod raised a hand and all three stopped. “Do any of you feel that?” Axelrod asked, his heart beating madly, the adrenaline surging through him. The other two acknowledged they felt intense alarm. All three looked around a full 360 to find what was causing this nameless dread, a fear for their lives that was more intense than they had ever felt. 

Axelrod raised his arm and motioned forward. All three swallowed and slowly began moving forward. Again, the fear escalated; the three were sweating profusely. “Wait,” Costigan whispered hoarsely, and his trembling hand pointed directly westward on the track. Fifty yards ahead of him, the ghostly outlines of the three old homesteads were now in view, but Costigan was focused on something else. Directly ahead of the trio on the track, Costigan’s night vision scope showed an oval area of blackness about eight feet tall surrounded by the night scope’s normal green color. It was as if, Costigan said later, all light had been extinguished in that dark oval shape. Costigan felt the black structure was radiating a menacing presence. Neither Axelrod or Wilson could make out anything definitive in the gloom, but, as if in psychological agreement with what Costigan was seeing, they instinctively acknowledged that the source of their fear was 50 yards further down the track. At that point, all three felt close to their breaking point, each one convinced that continuing towards the dark oval shape would lead to certain death. 

Without a word, the three began to retrace their steps, as if guided by the same direct order. Slowly, as they walked back, the terror began to subside. As if on a rheostat, the further they retreated from the mysterious black oval shape on the track, the less fear they felt. After a hundred yards, the fear had left them. Silently, the three walked back to the Command and Control Center trailer, located on the east end of the ranch, for the debriefing. 

A couple of years later, AAWSAP BAASS program manager Kelleher interviewed Axelrod and Costigan separately about the events on the ranch that night. Both remained baffled regarding the source of the fear, and the interview confirmed that only Costigan saw the black oval shape through a night vision scope. The implication was that the oval structure could not be seen in the visible wavelengths (400 to 700 nanometers) and had only been illuminated above 850 nanometers. 

The next day, the atmosphere was much lighter, the three comrades were back to joking, and the sun shone beautifully on the serene ranch. It was if the terrifying events of the night before had never happened or had happened in a different reality. The rest of the day was uneventful; the three had walked the full length of the property without any negative effects. The three then packed up and were back with their families in their homes in Virginia and Maryland the following night. 

Ten days after the ranch episode Kelleher received a call from Axelrod. He sounded puzzled as he recounted that almost immediately after he had returned home from Skinwalker Ranch strange things had begun to happen in their home, not to him, but to his family. Axelrod recounted that on the previous night at about 2 a.m. while he was asleep beside his wife, Ruth, she had seen a large black humanoid shape walking towards her in their bedroom. Ruth did not scare easily, but she had felt alarmed and turned on the light but saw nothing. Ten minutes later, she clearly heard footsteps coming slowly up the stairs. She slipped out of her bed and walked to the landing. But there was nobody there. Quickly she walked to her teenage sons’ bedrooms and saw that both were asleep in their beds. Axelrod said his wife was not completely freaked out, but the episode had concerned her. 

During a second call about a month later, Axelrod reported an alarming escalation in anomalous activity at his home. All of the activity appeared to be directed against his family. On several occasions, Axelrod was out of town. Axelrod reported that while he was on one mission overseas, his 16-year-old son, Paul, woke at night with multiple small blue “orbs” flying around his room; occasionally, one would fly very close to him. According to Paul, the orbs appeared to be moving under some kind of control. When he began yelling, his mother ran in the room, but the orbs were instantly gone. Even after the bizarre night with the orbs, Ruth continued seeing shadow-like figures in her home, and she routinely heard loud noises down in the kitchen after everybody had gone to bed. Ruth and Jonathan Axelrod were certain that these events had begun after he had returned home from his trip to Skinwalker Ranch. 

Later, an even more bizarre event with strong links to the Skinwalker Ranch erupted in the Axelrod home. Again, Jonathan was out of town on a work assignment. It was after midnight, and Ruth had turned off all the lights in the kitchen and was preparing to go upstairs when her eye caught a movement out in the yard. She walked over to the window for a better look, then froze as she witnessed one of the most bizarre sights she had ever beheld. Standing upright and leaning against one of the trees at the perimeter of her yard was a huge wolf-like creature. She saw the creature plainly in the dim night light. It had long hair and looked like a wolf. But it was standing on two legs. Ruth stood paralyzed, feeling both confusion and a kind of dread. 

The creature appeared to be staring right at her; its gaze was not friendly. She continued to stare at this eerie sight, trying to fathom the impossibility of an upright wolf-like creature in a quiet, upper middle-class suburban Virginia neighborhood. The creature then took one last look at her, turned, and walked slowly on two legs further into the tree line. Within minutes, she had lost sight of it. She stood there a long time trying to determine if she had just had a very intense hallucination, or if her mind was beginning to go. The scene had been so bizarre and frightening she decided not to call her husband or to tell her kids. The kids were stable and well-adjusted, but Ruth had noticed that they were on edge from the unexplained events that had happened in their household. Ruth went to bed and tried to put the surreal vision out of her mind. 

Three days later, at about 10:30 on a bright Saturday morning, the two teenage Axelrod sons were downstairs in the living room. When Paul got up to stretch his legs, a movement in the yard caught his eye, and he gasped in astonishment at the sight of a huge wolf-like creature standing on two legs in the backyard staring straight at him. Alerted by his brother’s gasp, Michael jumped up and saw the seven-foot-tall “wolf” gazing menacingly at them. The animal appeared to be completely comfortable standing on two legs. Both Axelrod boys felt a sense of fear. Suddenly the beast took off running towards the tree line, its long brown, black hair blowing in the rapid movement. The beast ran easily and fluidly on its hind legs with long strides seemingly impossible for normal canine anatomy. Both boys stood in silence as the wolf was soon lost in the trees that bordered the Axelrod property. The thick insulated windows had prevented them from hearing any sound from the beast’s transit across their yard. A couple of hours later when Ruth came back, the boys breathlessly told their mother about the event. Ruth felt a deep chill as they excitedly described in detail an apparition identical to what she had seen a few nights previously and that she was still hoping was a hallucination. 

By the time Jonathan returned from his mission, the Axelrod boys had researched what it was they had seen, trying to find some confirmation that the bizarre event had been real. The teenagers had become familiar with Linda Godfrey’s books on “Dogmen,” and as they described their sighting to their father, Jonathan felt a chill. Ruth’s description was even more disturbing because she described the beast looking at her in a malevolent way, exuding a threatening demeanor. The following day, the family found that numerous trees in their yard had fresh, deep scars on the bark as if sharp objects had drawn vertical lines down the tree. “Claw marks” was the definitive description that Jonathan Axelrod relayed to Kelleher in a subsequent interview.

The appearance of the upright wolf-like beast in the backyard of the Axelrod home in Virginia led to a feeling of deep unease in Jonathan’s mind. He confessed being disturbed; while his busy professional career with Naval Intelligence was intensifying with his daily engagement on multiple highly classified advanced technology projects, his home was turning into a bizarre paranormal Disneyland. 

Within a few months of his return from Skinwalker Ranch, every member of his family had experienced orbs in their home, seen dark humanoid creatures in their bedrooms, and heard multiple sounds of footsteps around the house at night. The uncanny temporal crossover between the “normal” common events on Skinwalker Ranch and the literal explosion of bizarre anomalies at their home two thousand miles east in suburban Virginia led Jonathan to the inescapable possibility that something had attached itself to him while he was on the ranch, and that he had brought that something home with him. Either this was a complete coincidence, or he, Jonathan Axelrod, was responsible for the creepy, disturbing unfolding of bizarre activity that was slowly overtaking his home.

Chapter 2: Harry Reid

Retirement parties rarely create much media buzz. Senator Harry Reid’s farewell to Congress was an exception. On the afternoon of December 8, 2016, the stately and historic Kennedy Caucus Room was packed with Reid’s family, political supporters, current and former staff members, and a small army of journalists, most of whom stood in the back of the room, crammed elbow to elbow, in a line that stretched the length of the rear wall.

One by one, the speakers for the event entered the room and took their seats in front of the crowd. Vice President Joe Biden, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Republican Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell, and newly designated Senate Democratic Leader Senator Chuck Schumer were joined by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, making her highest-profile public appearance in Washington since losing the Electoral College vote to Donald Trump four weeks earlier. When she rose to speak about Reid, the audience responded with a standing ovation.

“This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election,” Clinton joked. “After a few weeks of taking selfies in the woods, I thought it would be a good idea to come out.”

Clinton, who had worked closely with Reid during her years as a U.S. Senator from New York, praised Reid’s formidable reputation as a “fighter,” and singled out his support for health care reform and public lands protections, among other accomplishments. Vice President Biden, whose long career in the Senate included the years when Reid served as Majority Leader, cracked jokes, interacted with Reid’s wife, and mentioned Reid’s willingness to take political bullets on behalf of his caucus members on tough votes such as arms control, the Wall Street bailout, and health care.

“Love you, pal,” Biden said while looking at Reid. “I know that embarrasses you, but I do. “

Pelosi, Schumer, and even Reid’s longtime adversary, McConnell, piled on the accolades, each mentioning various causes and programs Reid had championed during his 34 years in Congress. All of the speakers were well aware of Reid’s aversion to praise, an admittedly unusual quality for a career politician. Observers noted that Reid seemed visibly uncomfortable during the remarks made by his prominent colleagues. Eventually, he took the microphone, thanked several of his closest allies, and then touched on a list of his proudest legislative highlights, a truncated version of the more detailed address he had delivered earlier in the day in the well of the Senate.

Neither Reid nor any of the other speakers that day made any mention of something else he had initiated, an obscure endeavor that was created in secrecy and was always intended to be kept quiet. Nonetheless, it’s a program that has generated worldwide publicity in recent years and likely will be remembered as a notable piece of Reid’s political legacy. One year after Reid made his formal farewell to Washington, the veteran lawmaker was thrust back into a global limelight in what might be the biggest news story of his long career. 

The program he had quietly championed nine years earlier—but never acknowledged or even mentioned publicly—was finally revealed in a sensational, front-page story in The New York Times. The Times report described the program as a secretive military study of UFOs, Unidentified Flying Objects, aka flying saucers. According to the story, the name of the program was AATIP, an acronym for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. AATIP was not the name of the program Reid initiated, but it is the name that has stuck, thanks to an avalanche of mainstream media news coverage that reverberated around the planet and continues to the present date.

Reid never imagined that the UFO study he quietly sponsored would become an enduring part of his legislative legacy. But, years after The New York Times story broke, public interest in “AATIP” secrets remained high, and mainstream news stories about UFO cases were a nearly daily occurrence. The former senator has grown more comfortable with his seemingly unlikely role in modern UFO history.

“This is not my legacy. I think I will be remembered for other things,” Reid said in a 2019 interview with the authors. “But hey, if I’m known as somebody that kind of got the ball rolling, I’ll take it. Even my wife, who initially thought ‘what are you doing, talking about all this stuff?,’ changed her mind. After all the media stories about seeing these ‘Tic Tacs’ and things in the water, my wife said ‘maybe you aren’t crazy after all.’”

Throughout his long and tumultuous career in government, Reid was widely known as a crafty tactician and political pragmatist, a Machiavellian strategist, indomitable presence, and perceived “puppet master” whose fingerprints were seen (or suspected) in nearly every political race in his home state, and whose reputation for both ruthlessness and pragmatism catapulted him to the heights of power in Washington. Reid was an atypical politician by nearly every standard. He was soft-spoken, prone to making off-the-cuff remarks, and seemingly cared little about his image. Political pundits had often declared Reid as political dead meat in his home state, yet he bounced back from bitter defeats and survived several razor-thin elections to eventually become Senate Majority Leader, the most powerful Nevada politician in history. Even after leaving office, he was sought out by former congressional colleagues and by presidential hopefuls, as well as by major media outlets.

In a 2019 article titled “The Kingmaker,” The Atlantic referred to post-Senate Reid as a “deadpan sphinx or elliptical oracle. His pronouncements arrive with the mystique of messages from another plane of existence, like the ant farmer surveying the tunnels from outside the glass.” But why would a shrewd and experienced political survivor like Reid put his credibility and career on the line by tackling an issue that, for decades, had been mocked, derided, and ridiculed? For elected officials—as for scientists and journalists—the UFO subject was and is inherently perilous, a considerable risk to one’s personal and professional credibility.

How Harry Reid Became the UFO Senator

Reid’s abiding interest in UFOs dates back at least three decades. The first public hint was revealed on November 10, 1989, in a live interview with a Las Vegas television station. KLAS TV, a CBS affiliate and Nevada’s first licensed television operation, was five days into an ambitious, nine-part investigative series titled “UFOs: The Best Evidence.” During the 5 p.m. newscast, Reid was interviewed via a satellite link. He acknowledged that he was aware of the series and planned to get caught up by watching the recordings of the episodes that had already aired. Reid then took it a step further. He noted that Congress had previously held hearings into the UFO issue. When prompted, the senator said it might be time for another round of congressional hearings to look into UFO questions. Other than two hearings in the 1960s, no follow up congressional inquiries materialized, but Reid’s personal interest in the topic continued for the rest of his political career.

Eight months earlier, Reid spoke privately with KLAS TV reporter George Knapp. Knapp was investigating sensational allegations that had been made about supposedly alien technology being stored and tested at a previously unknown facility near Groom Lake, Nevada, better known as Area 51. Knapp had first met Reid while covering the election campaigns of 1982 and 1984, when Reid was elected to his first terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the two interacted again during the tumultuous 1986 election when Reid won his first term in the U.S. Senate. 

“Senator Reid was the first person outside of our newsroom that I talked about the UFO project we were pursuing,” Knapp recalls. “It seemed like something he would want to know, so I requested some time for a private conversation. In early June, I got a call from his office, and they arranged for me to meet with him. We talked during a drive to McCarran airport, as he was on his way back to Washington, D.C. I told him what I was working on, about the multiple sources I had developed who had told me something really weird was being hidden out in the desert. And to my surprise, he didn’t boot me out of his vehicle.”

Reid said he was interested and would ask around. He and Knapp agreed to stay in touch about the UFO topic, and they did. During the early 1990s, Reid’s office helped Knapp acquire a few hard-to-get UFO items, including a copy of the out-of-print congressional hearings from 1966 and 1968, as well as a surprisingly in-depth UFO report prepared for members of Congress by the Congressional Research Service. Knapp kept Reid in the loop about notable developments in the UFO field that became news stories for KLAS TV and other media outlets. 

But Reid’s interest in UFOs went much deeper than an occasional news report. It was also consistent with his religious beliefs. During his long career in government, Reid had made no secret of his conversion to the LDS faith, but unlike many in politics, he was never a Bible thumper. Reid rarely mentioned his Mormon beliefs in public statements, never arranged photo ops of himself attending church services, and steered clear of invoking the name of God in the defense of his policy positions or proposed legislation. Unless prompted by reporters in interviews, Reid wasn’t a guy who wore his religion on his sleeve. But by the eighth decade of his life, he was ready to concede that LDS doctrine helped shape his interest in the possibility of alien life.

“Anyone who’s looked at Mormonism at all understands that we believe there are other worlds,” Reid told Knapp in 2018. “It’s one reason people looked askew at Mormonism for a long time. They’d ask, ‘are these people crazy, taking about other worlds?’ Well, Joseph Smith came up with this idea. I think there is no question there are other worlds, so yes, my religious beliefs are compatible 100 percent.” 

In the mid-1990s, Reid was given a chance to put his faith into action. Las Vegas businessman Robert Bigelow, who’d spent large sums of money to fund the work of several UFO organizations as well as individual researchers, made the decision to create his own UFO research group. The National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) was created in 1995, in part because of Bigelow’s frustration with a lack of definitive results from the investigators who had accepted his financial support. NIDS had two primary focal points—UFOs and consciousness studies, more specifically whether human consciousness survives death. A world-class Science Advisory Board (SAB) was assembled, made up of academics, writers, former intelligence officials, and other professionals who’d spent years in the murky trenches of Ufology and other frontier sciences.

The board had its first organizational meeting in December 1995 in Las Vegas. A second meeting in January 1996 marked the first time most of the NIDS board was together in the same room. Among those in attendance were physicist Dr. Hal Puthoff; computer scientist and longtime UFO investigator and author, Dr. Jacques Vallee; former astronaut and U.S. Senator, Harrison Schmitt; Dr. John Mack of Harvard; former US Army Intelligence officer Dr. John Alexander; and several other notables. Journalist George Knapp made a presentation to the board about the UFO files he’d obtained during a trip to the former USSR.

Following that meeting, Knapp mentioned to Reid that NIDS was up and running and suggested that Reid might be interested in what the organization was trying to achieve. Reid expressed an interest in attending a future meeting, and Knapp informed Bigelow, who subsequently reached out to Reid. (As a young attorney, Reid once represented the Bigelow family in a case involving a fatal airplane crash.)

Reid and Bigelow began communicating and eventually figured out a date that worked for all parties. The senator was invited to attend what turned out to be the fifth overall meeting of the NIDS board. It was held in Las Vegas on August 3, 1996. Vallee delivered the main presentation at the meeting. Organizational issues were discussed and debated. Board members learned that three full-time staff members had been hired: biochemist Colm Kelleher, physicist Eric Davis, and microbiologist/veterinarian George Onet—three men whose abilities would later be put to the test at a Utah property that would eventually be known to the rest of the world as Skinwalker Ranch. 

Reid watched the proceedings in utter amazement, absorbed everything he heard, and confided in friends later that, from that point on, he was hooked and wanted to know everything he could about UFOs and related mysteries. He found the SAB members to be credible, inquisitive, and honest about wanting to find answers to life’s biggest mysteries. Reid and Bigelow stayed in frequent contact after the 1996 meeting.

“I’m a curious person. I sometimes have felt inadequate about my knowledge of science, for a lot of reasons. Maybe I don’t have a scientific mind,” Reid told Knapp in 2019. “But I’m terribly interested in this [UFOs] and I decided it is something I’m going to try to keep up with for as long as I can.”

Reid kept his interest quiet, sharing it with only a few of his most trusted staffers. On a few occasions, he brought it up in conversations with other power players in Washington. One such opportunity came in 1997. Reid had an opening to talk about it with his colleague and fellow Democrat Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Glenn had achieved the status of an American hero during the earliest days of the U.S. space program, becoming perhaps the best known of the original Mercury astronauts.

The impetus for a conversation between Reid and Glenn about UFOs was a seemingly unrelated news story being pursued by KLAS TV in Las Vegas. The news station was investigating the plight of chimpanzees that had been acquired and bred by NASA for use in the space program. Dozens of the “space chimps” had been discarded by NASA and were being subjected to horrific biomedical experiments (injected with various deadly diseases) at facility in New Mexico. The lab had been cited for numerous violations of federal animal welfare regulations. Reporter George Knapp reached out to Reid about the chimps. Reid invited Knapp to come to Washington to record an interview. When Knapp and his photographer arrived in the Senate’s media room, Reid had a surprise.

“Senator Reid figured out a way to add more firepower to the story about the space chimps by getting John Glenn involved,” Knapp recalls. “So, when we got to DC, he asked how I’d feel about interviewing John Glenn at the same time. Needless to say, we were pretty jazzed about it.”

Glenn’s stature as a former astronaut, combined with Reid’s political savvy, combined to have a positive effect on the future of the space chimps. The television interview with the two senators caught the attention of federal officials who oversaw the New Mexico lab, and within months lab officials announced that the facility would shut down its experiments on chimpanzees. The chimps were eventually retired to a humane facility in Florida. 

That interaction with Glenn gave Reid an opening to ask Glenn about UFOs. “We talked about it. I never pressed him on why he was curious because I didn’t want to be too pushy,” Reid said, “but John Glenn was very interested in it”.

The Birth of AAWSAP

Since his retirement from political office, Reid has opened up about other notables with whom he discussed UFOs, including President Bill Clinton, late Senate maverick John McCain, and former Vice-Presidential candidate Sen. Joe Lieberman.

Reid’s most notable contribution to the investigation of UFOs started in 2007. Businessman Robert Bigelow called Reid from Las Vegas and told the senator about a letter Bigelow had received from James Lacatski, a rocket scientist who worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon’s version of the CIA. The letter he sent to Bigelow in June 2007 sought permission to visit a ranch property Bigelow owned near Fort Duchesne, Utah.

“I presently work in the Defense Warning Office of the DIA,” Lacatski wrote. “The purpose of my visit would be to assist me in developing a strategy on how my office can characterize the potential threat aspects of the phenomena encountered in your research efforts.”

The letter went on to say the visit to the ranch might allow Lacatski to understand the lay of the land in evaluating possible threats. “In my division’s threat publications, it is not necessary for the reader to understand the complete nature and motivation of the threat sources, only the specifics of the threat itself . . . this allows for publication at lower classification levels and therefore to a wider audience. In the case of your ranch, potential threat characteristics should be able to eventually be described . . . though the source of those potential threats remains unknown.”

Lacatski’s carefully worded message suggested to Bigelow that the DIA man was more than familiar with the strange phenomena that had been reported in the Uintah Basin for generations. Reports of intelligently-controlled orbs and lights, structured craft, including classic flying saucers, unidentifiable animals, inexplicable livestock mutilations, Bigfoot creatures, poltergeist-type phenomena, apparent “holes in the sky,” and a long list of other seemingly paranormal events have been reported in the northeast corner of Utah since the late 1700s. Bigelow’s NIDS investigators had spent several years on the ground in the basin and had documented scores of truly bizarre events in and around a particular 480-acre ranch property. In 2005, the book Hunt for the Skinwalker, written by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp, chronicled the effort of the NIDS scientists to study and understand the place that came to be known as Skinwalker Ranch.

Chapter 3: James T. Lacatski—Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program

In 2007, Dr. James T. Lacatski was an intelligence officer serving in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Defense Warning Office (DWO). He served as Team Leader for writing the annual Missile Defense Threat Environment series, the SECRET-level threat documents used by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). Lacatski had been employed by DIA since 1998, previously supporting the MDA as a contractor covering defense system countermeasures, primarily in the areas of adversary electronic warfare and directed energy weapon capabilities.

In addition to his MDA support duties, in 2008 Lacatski became the DIA program manager, Contracting Officer Representative (COR), security coordinator, and counterintelligence coordinator of a multi-year $22 million DIA contract covering exotic aerospace technologies. As described in more detail elsewhere in this book, he used Congressional interest from bipartisan Senate leadership and the assistance of two DIA Directors to obtain multiple years of funding directed to the DIA Directorate of Analysis, specifically DWO. Lacatski then developed the strategic guidance and architecture for a new contractor support effort, and with the concurrence of the DIA Directorate of Finance, wrote a small-business set-aside solicitation (HHM402-08-R-0211) using the then-new statement-of-objectives format. It was issued 18 August 2008 on the Federal Business Opportunities website, with a proposal due date of 10 September 2008. On 22 September 2008, a contract (HHM402-08-C-0072) was awarded to the sole bidder, Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), for an initial duration of two years.

In the case of statement-of-objectives format solicitations, government objectives (in this case, DIA’s) are articulated, while the offeror (in this case, BAASS) proposes how those objectives might be obtained and at what cost. Therefore, in order to totally understand a contract developed by this method, the solicitation, the proposal, and the government acceptance or partial acceptance of the proposal must all be known. Having the solicitations’ statement of objectives alone is insufficient.

As shown in HHM402-08-R-0211, Lacatski placed the following statement of objectives for the new Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) into the solicitation. The name of the program was specifically chosen to assist in the routing of new congressional money to DWO. This is a crucial point because the use of any other name, for example AATIP, would have been problematic, as the routing of the money would not have gone to DWO. 

The HHM402-08-R-0211 solicitation states:

AAWSAP Statement of Objectives

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES FOR THE ADVANCED AEROSPACE WEAPON SYSTEM APPLICATIONS PROGRAM 1. BACKGROUND: DWO of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has the responsibility to provide guidance and oversight to the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition process along with leveraging the DoD Intelligence Community to coordinate, produce and maintain projections of the future threat environment in which U.S. air, naval, ground, space, missile defense and information systems operate. In order to accurately assess the foreign threat to U.S. weapon systems, a complete as possible understanding of potential breakthrough technology applications employed in future aerospace weapon systems must be obtained. 2. OBJECTIVE: One aspect of the future threat environment involves advanced aerospace weapon system applications. The objective of this program is to understand the physics and engineering of these applications as they apply to the foreign threat out to the far term, i.e., from now through the year 2050. Primary focus is on breakthrough technologies and applications that create discontinuities in currently evolving technology trends. The focus is not on extrapolations of current aerospace technology. The proposal shall describe a technical approach which discusses how the breakthrough technologies and applications listed below would be studied and include proposed key personnel that have experience in those areas. 3. REQUIREMENTS: a) The contractor shall complete advanced aerospace weapon system technical studies in the following areas: 1. lift; 2. propulsion; 3. control; 4. power generation; 5. spatial temporal translation; 6. materials; 7. configuration, structure; 8. signature reduction (optical, infrared, radiofrequency, acoustic); 9. human interface; 10. human effects; 11. armament (RF and DEW); 12. other peripheral areas in support of (1-11); b) It is expected that numerous experts with extensive experience (minimum of 10 years) in breakthrough aerospace research and development will be required. c) A technical plan for conducting the advanced aerospace weapon system studies must be submitted by the contractor.

By 10 September 2008, a single proposal had been received by DIA. In satisfaction of the requirements in the statement of objectives, BAASS proposed the following nine approaches [wording has been condensed]:

BAASS Proposal Approaches

First Approach—Global Data Collection

First, BAASS will initiate a thorough, detailed high-caliber data base about what has been seen, recorded or measured by anyone foreign and domestic, military or civilian with regard to craft exhibiting advanced aerospace characteristics. Since there are already organizations that have collected this data for years and are still doing so, affiliations with them would be helpful. These organizations could help to provide a large net to capture significant and diverse information.

Second Approach—Contact Program

A second approach is to seek out and contact scientists, engineers and companies that may have access to novel technologies; however, for various reasons they have not been able to move their research further along. We may offer access to an expanded field of scientists and perhaps future funds with which to work. 

Third Approach—Laboratory Program

BAASS would like to carefully use the property it owns in the Uintah Basin of Utah and the Uintah Basin in general as a living laboratory. For more than a hundred years and especially in the last sixty-five years this area is commonly known to have frequent exhibitions of anomalous spacecraft and other objects.

The Utah “Lab” has been and is occupied by ranch managers and security personnel. The security mission is first to keep unauthorized people off the property and secondly to provide assistance in an ongoing program of phenomena interaction. There appears to be some consciousness connection and interaction. BAASS would recommend the formation of a plan to utilize the Uintah Basin and possibly other “key” geographic areas outside of Utah as focal points for observation, contact and interaction.

Fourth Approach—Collect Oral Histories

As an adjunct to the above second approach, we consider it important to mount an effort to collect oral histories from a host of credible individuals who have important historical information that would otherwise almost certainly be lost as time progresses.

Fifth Approach—Potential Use of Bigelow Aerospace Space Platforms

It is clear that our advanced technologies are dependent on where, and under what circumstances, they are discovered and subsequently manufactured. This is especially true of unique technologies of one, two, or three generations in the future. For example, it is known that in the absence of gravity significant structural changes in organic and non-organic materials can be produced.

Therefore, our fifth suggested approach involves facilitating such research on board space platforms that Bigelow Aerospace intends to fabricate and deploy in low earth orbit in coming years.

Sixth Approach—DIA Data Access

A sixth area of opportunity, of course, lies with the DIA itself. Elimination of waste of time and money to acquire material or data of any kind already in the possession of various aerospace and electronics contractors, and by components of the intelligence community, will significantly enhance the productivity of our joint efforts to achieve the stated objectives.

Seventh Approach—Biological Effects of Advanced Technologies

This seventh approach addresses biological effects and human effects in particular. The search for and implementation of special types of advanced technologies upon humans (e.g., technology assisted consciousness, consciousness-assisted technology) may reveal a new generation of physical, psychological and sociopolitical effects. Such effects may involve/revolve around who has command of unusual technological or enhanced mental capabilities. The command of such capabilities may eclipse all conventional weaponry.

Eighth Approach—Remote Sensing

As an adjunct to satisfying the specific technical requirements of the program, an eighth approach is the implementation of a high-quality remote sensing (“remote viewing”) program. As DIA knows, this practice has been extensively researched and used on select, difficult-to acquire targets in the past.

We have affiliations with previous Program Managers and have access to pre-calibrated world class practitioners who were trained in the DIA program and whose track record is well established.

Ninth Approach—Expert Analysis and Synthesis

Given that the overall program encompasses a broad range of highly technical disciplines, the evaluation and synthesis of the materials generated from the activities outlined above demand an exceptionally qualified cadre of experts with experience in exotic technologies and arcane methodologies. BAASS is well-positioned to recruit from the ranks of present contacts an exceptional cohort of highly skilled and motivated lead scientists from the aerospace, research and academic communities.

AAWSAP Contract Award

In response to the BAASS proposal, DIA awarded a two-year AAWSAP contract (HHM402-08-C-0072) commencing on September 22, 2008. Approaches 1-4, 6, and 9 were accepted for a cost of $10 million for the 1st year. Those approaches comprised the operational functions of the AAWSAP contract, and the focus was never changed or modified during the life of the contract.

“This was a UFO program period. That was its perfect purpose from the start,” says Lacatski. “And furthermore, this was about how UFOs might fit into the realm of what we might consider the paranormal.” Lacatski believed then, as now, that a study focused solely on UFOs—on various unknown, nuts-and-bolts-type craft flitting around in the skies over military bases and facilities—would never get to the heart of a much larger and complicated mystery. “You’re going to be hunting for aliens cruising by from now until doomsday and you are never going to solve anything.”

After contract award, Lacatski worked with BAASS for a clear understanding of program direction and the diverse personnel needed (numerous PhDs, former law-enforcement investigators, field collection personnel, database developers, etc.). Since the contractor never had a government contract utilizing cleared personnel, experienced counter-intelligence personnel were placed in leadership and security roles to mitigate program threats from the start. Lacatski had a complete electronic counter-intelligence sweep conducted on all contractor leadership offices, meeting locations, and the contractor-owned building dedicated to this aerospace contract.

Lacatski worked directly with the Defense Security Service (DSS) under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual to successfully obtain a new Top Secret (TS) facility clearance for the contractor-owned building. He also worked directly with DIA to have a small Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) certified within this TS facility, but original construction flaws made this financially untenable. Therefore, Lacatski worked directly between DIA and the contractor as the contractor purchased a partially completed new building, the whole of which was then able to be modified to DIA SCIF standards.

As employees were hired and assigned to this contract, SCI clearances were obtained for leadership personnel, and Secret clearances were obtained for all other employees. Lacatski facilitated SCI approvals using DIA-contractor personnel (30-day background checks) and rapid adjudication. He reviewed all SCI SF-86 submissions and arranged with the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) to directly accept Secret-level SF-86s. The installation of secure communication systems was arranged for both landline and wireless.

Ultimately, more than 75 contractor personnel performed exotic aerospace research and several hundred part-time personnel conducted field work. A multi-million-dollar database to store contract research data was developed. For contractor products that would be published by DIA, 38 Defense Intelligence Reference Documents (DIRDs) to be exact, Lacatski provided final technical review and editing, and arranged for posting on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). Although only one published product was classified, the JWICS allowed for extensive distribution within the intelligence community and analyst review. Top ratings were received on all publications.

AAWSAP contract HHM402-08-C-0072 was exercised at a cost of $12 million for the 2nd year. Originally scheduled to end on September 30, 2010, the contract was extended by DIA at no cost to the government through December 21, 2010 to allow for final receipt of deliverables due to contract completion. Lacatski published the last of the 38 DIRDs on January 11, 2011. Voluminous high-quality material (more than a hundred separate reports, as detailed in Appendix I) was submitted to the DIA in just over two years of the program’s existence. In addition, the 11 data bases within the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse were delivered to DIA, while the massive holdings of the original analysts’ journals, data, and photographs, remained in storage.

For FY11, congressional funding was not available, otherwise AAWSAP could have continued in the DIA for the 3rd year. No decision was ever made to use the funding elsewhere. The money was simply unavailable. Money was available for FY12, but money was not the only issue. In 2011–2012, the pressing need for a Special Access Program (SAP) for contract data exploitation was determined to be absolutely necessary. Based on preliminary data, a letter had already been sent from Senator Harry Reid to Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn on June 24, 2009, requesting a SAP for AAWSAP. As detailed in chapter 10, the decision to create that SAP was postponed but the urgent need persisted. Oddly enough, the primary legacy of that letter was the new unclassified nickname, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), created exclusively for use within the unclassified letter. The AATIP acronym was adopted much later to describe a small unofficial effort within DoD to investigate UAPs encountered by the military. The New York Times article in December 2017 mistakenly linked the $22 million in funding to AATIP, not AAWSAP. AAWSAP was the official name of the $22 million program and was never changed. AATIP was not a funded program. 

As the AAWSAP program manager since its beginning at DIA, Lacatski knew that in order to continue the successes achieved and to reach its full potential, the program needed to move out of the Department of Defense (DoD). For FY12, DIA leadership had tried to transfer the program within the DoD, but without success and, unfortunately, missing the fiscal year’s appropriation deadline. Since AAWSAP was not strictly defense-oriented in nature, on February 7, 2011, Lacatski gave a very in depth briefing to colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate. 

At this point in time, the opportunity arose for DHS to receive $10 million in FY13 funding due to a collaborative effort between Senators Harry Reid and Joe Lieberman (then chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs). Lacatski worked with both senators to achieve the goal of a new DHS AAWSAP-like effort, but DHS leadership ultimately did not accept the new funding. More important though, DHS assistance was excellent in addressing some remaining AAWSAP issues during FY11-12. 

A unique situation was in play as DHS was interested in even the smallest details of AAWSAP. Discussions and briefings were numerous, with the support from BAASS deputy director Colm Kelleher and BAASS contractors Dr. Hal Puthoff and Dr. Norbert Black. This offered Lacatski the opportunity to become immersed in the voluminous research data acquired by AAWSAP. And while the focus of the program had never changed since its inception in 2008, all during that time Lacatski still had to perform his duties as a ballistic missile and land-attack cruise missile threat analyst. It is through these discussions and briefings at DHS that Lacatski was able to step back and examine the “big picture” aspects of AAWSAP. It is in this repetitive examination of the data, the total of which are being described in this book, that true insight into the lessons-learned from AAWSAP can be attained. All data submitted to DIA by BAASS is listed in Appendix I.

Eventually Lacatski briefed Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on AAWSAP’s overall objectives and the results of this multi-year research effort.

For FY14 with the assistance of Congressman Steny Hoyer, and again in FY15, Senator Reid and Lacatski attempted to fund AAWSAP through the DoD. Both attempts failed. Finally, on May 13, 2016, Lacatski retired from government service. So, after nine years of effort, the work of AAWSAP ended.

Or did it? Did AAWSAP really end? Its functions go on, perhaps not in a single program and not by a single name, and not necessarily as only a government program but they nevertheless continue. The United States Government has declared that it has updated reporting methods for military observation of UAPs and continues to assess their threat. In fact, the initial high-ranking individual leading the UAPTF had complete knowledge of the smallest nuances of AAWSAP. The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), whose performance in support of AAWSAP BAASS was exemplary, continues to thrive, as it investigates civilian UAP encounters. Research physicists such as Hal Puthoff, science advisor to AAWSAP BAASS, continue to explore commercial applications for UAP technology. The History Channel’s The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch series details the latest paranormal events occurring on Skinwalker Ranch and the current research taking place there employing the latest in surveillance technology.

Chapter 4: Robert T. Bigelow

Lara Logan: Is it risky for you to say in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens?

Robert Bigelow: I don’t give a damn. I don’t care

Logan: You don’t worry that some people will say, “Did you hear that guy, he sounds like he is crazy?”

Bigelow: I don’t care

Logan: Why not?

Bigelow: It’s not gonna make a difference. It’s not gonna change the reality of what I know. 

— Excerpt from the CBS 60 Minutes profile of Robert Bigelow

  


One of the main driving forces in the creation of the AAWSAP was the legendary aerospace mogul Robert T. Bigelow who has put more private money into the study of UAPs and paranormal phenomena than anybody else in the world. Beginning in the 1960s, Bigelow worked to build an extended stay apartment business that began with a single duplex and grew into a large real estate and property management empire of thousands of apartments in multiple states. 

Bigelow has publicly acknowledged that his long and successful business career was by and large inspired by his interest in the two central questions of human existence—are we alone in the universe and what happens when we die?

National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) 

Bigelow created the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) in 1995 with a two-fold mission: to research survival of consciousness after death and to research the UAP mystery. Within a year of the formation of NIDS, Bigelow had brought together a large science advisory team of physicists, engineers, psychiatrists, physicians, futurists, biologists, and subject matter experts with database expertise. 

In July of 1996, Colm Kelleher, Eric Davis, and George Onet were hired as a full time, salaried, core investigative team for NIDS. Over the years this core group was supplemented with a retired FBI special agent and an ex-AFOSI investigator, as well as additional web developer and computer science experts. As detailed in the book Hunt for the Skinwalker, the NIDS team became well known for in depth investigations on Skinwalker Ranch. The intensive study of Skinwalker Ranch yielded little tangible data, so much so that Bigelow in January 2021 told George Knapp: “I did not know with whom we were communicating . . . . and there are two choices, basically . . . . there was either discarnate entities, non-human entities or ETs.”

In addition to, and completely separate from, the work on Skinwalker Ranch, the NIDS team spent a lot of time and resources on an increasingly thorough investigation of cattle mutilations. New ground was broken on methodology and scientific approaches to cattle mutilations. The NIDS cattle mutilations protocols evolved into a rigorous set of procedures that were adopted for every mute investigation. Regardless of location, a qualified veterinarian was always called and arrived on site, standing over the dead animal within less than 36 hours of the mutilation event. Secondly the veterinarian was instructed to conduct a full necropsy to collect pathology samples and send identical samples to at least two accredited labs for histology and microscopic analysis. 

The NIDS team also pioneered in-depth chemical analysis on selected samples gathered during the necropsy, looking for any organic and inorganic compounds that should not have been there. Chemical analysis for an “unknown” compound in biological fluids is among the most difficult, time- and resource-consuming forensic challenges. 

As detailed in Chapter 12 research into the enigmatic black triangle UFOs was also pioneered at NIDS with the investigation of the Illinois triangle, which was independently witnessed by four police officers in different precincts on January 5, 2001.

By the time NIDS was disbanded in 2004, the organization created by Bigelow had developed a reputation for scientifically driven, high quality investigations of a wide variety of anomalies. Kelleher’s memories of brainstorming with Bigelow on the future of United States space ambitions while hiking and night watching on Skinwalker Ranch originated during the operation of NIDS. 

Bigelow, TransHab, and Bigelow Aerospace 

TransHab was a concept pursued by NASA in the 1990s to develop the technology for expandable habitats inflated by air in space. When deflated, expandable modules would provide a quantum leap in lower cost launches and lighter compact spacecraft. When fully expanded, TransHab would inflate to 8.2 meters in diameter, many times the diameter of the uninflated module. 

In 2000, despite multiple program successes, and after over a billion dollars in investment, Congressional House Resolution 1654 was signed into law prohibiting NASA from conducting further research and development on TransHab.

By 2000, Bigelow’s business acumen foresaw that the NASA TransHab program shuttered by Congress was a timely opportunity to license and develop this novel expandable technology in the private sector and truly make a difference to the United States Space Program. Bigelow quickly licensed the TransHab technology and set about accelerating and optimizing the development of expandable habitats. He purchased a 50-acre parcel in North Las Vegas and almost overnight multiple large buildings began to appear on the property. Success came quickly in 2006 and 2007 when Bigelow launched two small proof-of-concept expandable spacecraft called Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 from the Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan. All of the work leading to the development and successful deployments in orbit was 100% funded out of Bigelow’s own pocket. 

Building from the dual successes of Genesis 1 & 2, multiple spacecraft were rapidly developed at the cavernous Bigelow facility in North Las Vegas, including Galaxy, Sundancer, and ultimately B330, the company flagship space station. 

The very public realization of Bigelow’s vision came on April 8, 2016, when after only a few years of development, NASA launched into Low Earth Orbit the pathfinder BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module) spacecraft in the trunk of a Space X Dragon. Eight days later on April 16 the small BEAM spacecraft was seized by the Canadarm-2 robotic arm and successfully berthed to the Tranquility Node on the International Space Station (ISS). BEAM was the first privately owned, human-rated spacecraft in history to permanently attach to the ISS. It was a dramatic demonstration of the success of Bigelow’s fledgling company. 

BEAM was a revolution in spacecraft technology. But more importantly, BEAM broke a decades-long pattern of spacecraft development by the larger aerospace corporations costing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Costing NASA less than $18 million, “NASA got to test this novel expandable technology for pennies on the dollar,” in the words of then NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver. Within less than two years of operation on the ISS, NASA was so enamored with the BEAM spacecraft that it granted a “BEAM Life Extension” contract to Bigelow for multiple additional years on Tranquility Node 3 on ISS. 

Following on the BEAM success, Bigelow began investing large sums of his own money into the most ambitious spacecraft yet. Called the B330, for its 330 cubic feet in volume, it was designed to be a fully autonomous space station in its own right. The mighty spacecraft could be launched on multiple commercial launch vehicles in a volume of 60 cubic meters, and when in orbit would expand to a full 330 cubic meters. In addition to a full suite of life support systems to support four astronauts indefinitely in and beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the B330 was designed to have autonomous power generation, Guidance Navigation and Control, Avionics, Propulsion and Thermal Control Systems. 

In short, B330 was a flexibly designed space station capable of operating in LEO as a standalone space station, on the lunar surface, in Lunar Gateway as a transit point to the Moon or to Mars, and even as a Mars transit spacecraft. Bigelow’s B330 was of great interest to NASA, both as a potential “free Flier” in LEO but also as a potential Mars Transit vehicle. 

When Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak imposed a mandatory closure of all Nevada non-essential businesses as a COVID countermeasure in March 2020, Bigelow Aerospace went on ice. 

The pausing of the company that he had built since 1999 was a disappointment to Bigelow. He had already invested $350 million of his own funds towards making a difference with development of a groundbreaking technology that had the potential to revolutionize costs and access to LEO, the lunar surface, and to Mars. 

Regardless, the success of the BEAM program is an enduring part of Robert Bigelow’s legacy and continues to be a superb demonstration of private sector contributions to the United States missions in space.

Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies 

As described in detail in this book, beginning in 2008 Bigelow was also one of the main driving forces in the creation of AAWSAP BAASS that began in September 2008 and by the end of 2010 had distinguished itself within DIA as a highly professional, scientifically oriented organization. 

Fast forward to June 2020, Robert Bigelow embarked on yet another intellectually stimulating adventure by creating a brand-new organization called Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies (BICS). The mission of BICS is to study the survival of human consciousness after death and the afterlife utilizing the scientific method as well as other creative modalities. Regarding his reasons for exploring the survival of consciousness, Bigelow told Knapp in January 2021: “So, if you can, if people can be helped in the grief situation, in a sorrow situation by information, then any information isn’t something that hurts. It helps you, it’s a good gift to have that information.”

In January 2021 BICS launched an essay competition with $1.5 million in prize money that would be awarded to the best essay to summarize the evidence for survival of human consciousness after death. The essay competition achieved a massive global response with dozens of countries represented in the submitted essays. 

Throughout his career in studying anomalies and in creating his aerospace company, Robert Bigelow’s organizations have been notable for their scientific excellence, cutting edge innovation, and professionalism. As is well known, his business career has spanned over 50 years in real estate, property management, and banking, and in this latest venture Bigelow has also distinguished himself as a formidable talent. 

Kelleher, who reported directly to Robert Bigelow at four separate organizations spanning over 20 years (NIDS, Bigelow Aerospace, AAWSAP BAASS and BICS) observed that the Bigelow management style combined efficiency with organizational flexibility and fast turnaround problem solving. He found that Bigelow does not suffer fools gladly; his reputation for terminating people and departments that fail to deliver results is legendary and well deserved. At the same time, Kelleher sees Bigelow as a visionary who invariably understands a much bigger picture than most people.

Chapter 5: The Beginning

The dozen crucifixes and crosses are just my decorating style. Odd, though, the cross in the bathroom just flew off the wall and across the hall this morning.

—Skinwalker Ranch Manager Jean Dietz, July 2007 

  


In addition to being an exceptionally qualified ballistic missile physicist-intelligence analyst with decades of experience, James Lacatski had an innate curiosity with interests that often strayed away from the arcane confines of his craft. Reading the Hunt for the Skinwalker back in March of 2007 intrigued Lacatski. “I read the book cover to cover,” Lacatski says. “I was legitimately interested in this as useful to the military, and useful to my particular group, which was looking at possible threats to new weapons systems; that’s what attracted my attention.”

Lacatski was particularly captivated by the book’s accounts of the paranormal, and the more he read, the more alarmed he became that something technological of uncertain ownership might be operating undetected in United States airspace. After all, a lot of different objects that flew silently and had remarkable aerodynamic characteristics and widely different shapes and sizes seemed to have infested this particular quiet corner of the state of Utah. If they were flying at low altitude around Utah, where else were they flying, who owned them, who was flying them, and for what purpose?

Lacatski was shocked to learn that a team of professional scientists had covertly spent years, with full funding and utilizing the scientific method, studying bizarre phenomena that should only exist in comic books and horror movies. He wondered how such an eye-opening project had so successfully flown under the radar for so long.

In April of 2007 Lacatski sat down with his friend Jonathan Axelrod in the DWO office in Washington D.C. and began relaying to him the bizarre tales in Hunt for the Skinwalker. Axelrod, an open-minded thinker, listened politely and skeptically. As he was shipping out on covert assignment to Iraq two days later, he volunteered to take the book with him. Axelrod told us that as he sat around the pool in the Green Zone in Baghdad during his downtime, he began regaling his colleagues about the cattle mutilations, intelligently controlled orbs, weird flying machines, and bizarre creatures that seemed to be commonplace in a remote unpopulated corner of northeastern Utah. When Axelrod finished the book, he passed it on to an intelligence community colleague who also read it avidly, and within a month during early summer 2007, Hunt for the Skinwalker became the most popular book to read around the pool in the Green Zone. 

After some internal discussion with his colleagues and superiors at DIA, Lacatski decided to take the bull by the horns. On June 19, 2007, he wrote that bombshell letter on official DIA letterhead to Robert T. Bigelow asking to visit his Utah ranch for the purposes of “ . . . developing a strategy on how my office (DWO) can characterize the potential threat aspects of the phenomena encountered in your research efforts.” In the annals of ufology and anomalies, it is doubtful that any similar letter had ever been written by a high-ranking intelligence agency official to the CEO of an aerospace corporation proposing an official visit to a UFO hotspot to assess the technological threat potential of the phenomena on a place known as Skinwalker Ranch. The dry clinical prose of the letter belied an extraordinary audacity and showed that Lacatski was no ordinary intelligence agency bureaucrat. Lacatski was a man with the capacity and the vision to take risks.

After a few weeks of discussions, Lacatski was in the air on his way to meet Bigelow in Las Vegas. The quiet understated physicist-intelligence analyst and the charismatic aerospace billionaire were a study in contrasts, but they formed a bond at that first meeting that would be game changing in the years to come. 

On July 26, 2007, Lacatski and Robert Bigelow flew to Vernal Utah, the nearest airport to the ranch that could accommodate Bigelow’s private jet. Within an hour of landing in Vernal, both men were walking on the property. The ranch looked its finest on this beautiful July day, the Russian Olives and cedars were in full bloom and the pastures were looking their verdant best. Bigelow and Lacatski sauntered on the property for a short while and then headed for the nearest building. 

At the end of the entrance to the ranch was a small, picturesque dwelling which had been named Homestead 1. It housed Jean and Richard Dietz, a husband-wife team who had diligently managed the ranch property on Bigelow’s behalf since 1999. Bigelow introduced Lacatski to the managers in the dining room/kitchen of their house, which they had lovingly upgraded into a comfortable two-person home. 

Abruptly, Lacatski was transfixed by something behind where Bigelow and the couple were chatting: an unearthly technological device had suddenly and silently appeared out of nowhere in the adjacent kitchen. It looked to be a complex semi-opaque, yellowish, tubular structure. Lacatski said nothing but stared at the object, which was hovering silently. He looked away, looked back, and there it still was. It remained visible to Lacatski for no more than 30 seconds before vanishing on the spot. 

About two hours after they had arrived on the property, Lacatski and Bigelow were driving back to Vernal Airport. Although conversing normally with Bigelow, Lacatski‘s mind was racing. Here he was, a ballistic missile physicist, a senior analyst at the DIA without any history of encountering anomalies, and he had just seen a vision unlike anything he had ever witnessed in his life. Lacatski confessed later that prior to that stunning vision he had never seen anything unusual in his life. Yet within a mere 60 minutes of being on the Skinwalker property, he had seen clearly, in broad daylight, a technological device in the adjacent room within a few feet of where he stood. This was no blurry photo of a distant saucer in the sky, this was an in-your-face, up-close and personal apparition of some kind of technology. The fact that he, and he alone, of the four people in the room had seen it, was also not lost on Lacatski. 

What were the odds of something like that happening? Lacatski remembered reading that the NIDS team had spent hundreds of hours on the ranch and had encountered anomalies only occasionally. Yet here he had seen a spectacular object a few feet away within an hour of setting foot on the ranch. 

![](../Images/image00148.jpeg)

Later, while researching for some approximation of what he had witnessed during that astonishing two-hour interlude on the ranch, he came across a photograph of the album cover of Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells. There it was. The structure depicted on the album cover was not exact, but it was pretty close. 

In the days after the ranch sighting, Lacatski slowly began to formulate a plan for capitalizing on his extraordinary experience. He was convinced that there was some kind of significance to his vision. It was difficult for him to imagine that some random event had occurred to him precisely during the two hours he had spent on the legendary Utah ranch. The personal nature of the event motivated him to follow up with his superiors at DIA on the need to study the threat potential of technology of unknown origin in United States airspace, including UAPs. 

Suffice it say that in 2007 there were few men who could have accomplished what James T. Lacatski, Robert T. Bigelow, and Senator Harry Reid achieved. Once Bigelow had briefed his long-term friend Reid on the extraordinary history of UAPs at the Utah ranch, as well as on the recent astounding experience by a high-level Defense Intelligence Agency analyst on the same ranch, it did not take long for Senator Reid to connect Jim Lacatski with Senators Daniel Inouye of Hawaii and Ted Stevens of Alaska in a Capitol Building meeting. 

Senator Stevens had experienced his own sighting of a UAP as a World War II pilot, and Senators Reid and Inouye were strongly convinced that there were serious United States national security implications from the thousands of high quality UAP sightings by credentialed, professional individuals within the airspace of the United States for decades. 

In the toxic political environment of 2021, it seems almost quaint to imagine a bipartisan triad of powerful, long-serving senators working together for the security of the United States to lobby the leadership of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee to create the $22 million appropriation language for a program to research threat potential of UAPs. But that is exactly what happened. The Senators also designated the Defense Warning Office (DWO) at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as the architect of the program, thoughtfully named the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) specifically because the program and the money was targeted to DWO at DIA. No other names for the program were either contemplated or discussed; this AAWSAP name was created in order to make sure the $22 million Program Element (PE) reached DWO, and only DWO, at DIA. No variations on the AAWSAP name would have been allowed because of the technical nature of the PE financial conduit.

The result was a unique, successful program that broke new ground in the history of the tortured ambiguous relationship between the United States Government and UFOs, now known as UAPs.

The Request for Proposals 

The upshot of this extraordinary partnership was that in 2008 an official solicitation/RFP from the Defense Intelligence Agency appeared on the Fed Biz Opps (FBO) website that invited aerospace and defense companies to compete for a five-year funding contract to study advanced aerospace threats. The FBO website is one of many standard vehicles where the United States Government agencies and Departments (NASA, DARPA, DoD, etc.) publishes RFPs. 

The DIA RFP was specific in that it requested that the study focus on 12 main areas of Advanced Aerospace performance: (1) Lift, (2) Propulsion, (3) Control, (4) Power Generation, (5) Spatial/Temporal Translation, (6) Materials, (7) Configuration/Structure, (8) Signature Reduction (Optical/IR/RF/Acoustic), (9) Human Interface, (10) Human effects, (11) Armament (Radio Frequency and Directed Energy Weapons), and (12) Other areas in support of the first 11 performance items. A glance at the list of specifications for the study of Advanced Aerospace Vehicles included such items as “Spatial/Temporal Translation” and “Human Effects,” and indicated that the entire list could also be utilized for the study of UAPs. 

The key point here is that the official solicitation appeared publicly, requesting proposals from all aerospace/defense contractors. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the open, competitive nature of the solicitation, and there was certainly no sole sourcing involved. According to DIA sources, at least three separate aerospace companies expressed interest in submitting a proposal. 

In 2008, Robert Bigelow formed a sister company to Bigelow Aerospace and responded to the DIA’s solicitation. The name of the new company was Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS). It is understood that no one else actually submitted a proposal to the solicitation. In September 2008, Robert Bigelow was notified that BAASS had won the AAWSAP contract, and that Jim Lacatski was designated as the Program Manager and Contracting Officer Representative (COR). Funding for the first year was approximately $10 million with the opportunity to renew the contract on an annual basis thereafter.

As always, Robert Bigelow moved fast once he had been awarded the contract. Within a few weeks Bigelow had allocated a building for the program and had begun the process of extensive renovations in anticipation of obtaining a Facility Security Clearance for the structure. In addition, he began reaching out to several of the old NIDS Science Advisory Board members in order to solicit advice and input on quickly building an organization. 

By early November 2008 Bigelow had hired Colm Kelleher, who rapidly transitioned from a biotechnology management position in San Francisco to recession hit Las Vegas. Kelleher was the first full-time BAASS employee, and his job title was BAASS Deputy Administrator (with Bigelow as CEO and Administrator). For Kelleher, this sudden transition from the world of medicinal chemistry dealing with the deadliest viruses on Earth, to an official, fully funded government program to tackle UAPs was a dramatic change.

Kelleher knew that the first year AAWSAP contract was a unique and delicate flower that had to be nurtured, protected, and grown as fast as possible. He knew that the only way of renewing the one-year contract was to hit the ball out of the park on the end-of-year report. There was no time to waste.

The major challenge for the newly formed BAASS was to build the organizational structure as well as the security infrastructure for handling classified documents and communications devices. As Kelleher was doing this in Las Vegas, Lacatski faced the daunting task of accelerating the normal slow-moving government side at DWO.

First Hire at BAASS: The Tic Tac Case Was   
an AAWSAP Program

Within weeks of landing in Las Vegas, Kelleher had begun the process of advertising and interviewing for the BAASS organization. By early December 2008, he had already conducted multiple telephone interviews when retired marine Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Kurth presented himself for interview at Bigelow corporate headquarters. Kurth had an impressive resume. He was quiet spoken but exuded professionalism and efficiency. Within ten minutes of the beginning of the interview, Kelleher knew he had BAASS’s second hire. 

Towards the end of the interview, Kurth dropped a bombshell. He explained that in his previous career he had been the commanding officer of the Red Devils, a Marine Corps F/A-18C squadron that was a part of the USS Strike Group Nimitz southwest of San Diego in November-December 2004. Kurth went on to describe in detail his participation in what has now become known as the Tic Tac event, arguably, in 2021, the most famous UAP case in the world. 

Kelleher listened intently as Kurth described in measured tones how, about 30 minutes after being airborne from the Nimitz carrier on a beautiful cloudless day, he received a radio call asking him to investigate an unidentified airborne contact. As Kurth approached about 15 nautical miles from the reference point, he descended through 15,000 ft and saw “a rather large disturbance in the ocean surface.” Kurth emphasized that “the seas were surprisingly calm that day with rolling swells but no surface waves.” 

Kelleher knew that this event, during which United States Navy Commander David Fravor had now famously seen and engaged with the unidentified object that later became known as the Tic Tac, could be an important case to investigate for the fledgling BAASS organization as a part of the AAWSAP contract. Kurth wrote up his recollection of the Tic Tac case and even produced a comprehensive list of eyewitnesses to contact, which Kelleher submitted to Jim Lacatski at DIA. 

Lacatski, in turn, brought his friend Jonathan Axelrod on the case, and within months Axelrod and his team had comprehensively interviewed and obtained detailed testimony from more than a dozen pilots, radar operators, and other witnesses from the USS Nimitz, USS Princeton, and other sources. 

As the world now knows, the case remained on “close hold” within a small group at BAASS and DIA until eight years later when the explosive New York Times article of December 2017 hit the global public like a sledgehammer. The AAWSAP investigation of the Tic Tac is discussed in Chapter 13. 

Even in June 2021, Kelleher found it ironic that in spite of the tens of thousands of newspaper articles, blog posts, and TV shows since the December 2017 article that first broke the Tic Tac case, nobody had yet focused on the foundational and fundamental roles that Doug Kurth and AAWSAP had played in making this extraordinary UAP case public knowledge. 

Back at DIA headquarters in Washington, D.C., Lacatski was the primary mover and shaker in fast tracking many of the BAASS infrastructure processes. Kelleher, Bigelow, and Lacatski had initiated many of the security infrastructure requirements, and Lacatski was able to disentangle some of the red tape and expedite in weeks many processes that normally took months to be accomplished. 

Also, in another indication of the accelerated progress of a government program, within eight weeks of the initiation of the contract, Kelleher, Bigelow, and team had submitted a comprehensive Project Manager Report (PMR) to DIA that comprised the first deliverable requirement as part of the AAWSAP contract. To reiterate, AAWSAP was the official DIA designated name for the contract and BAASS was the official organization tasked with executing the AAWSAP contract.

Once the plan had been accepted by the DIA, Lacatski and his colleagues became amazingly effective at running interference to protect the AAWSAP from the usual hordes of bureaucratic parasites and bottom feeders that were endeavoring to purloin some of the contract’s money. In fact, Lacatski and his team were 100% successful in protecting the AAWSAP finances from assorted “haircuts,” taxes, tithes, and other bureaucratic attempts to extract money from the program. The DIA AAWSAP contract thus became a shining example of the original program money actually being used for its stated purpose. 

Project Physics

BAASS and DIA negotiated closely and discussed the contents of an important first baseline study that DIA called Project Physics. The purpose of Project Physics was to create a repository of position papers by world experts that defined the current and projected state of the art in Aerospace Technology, all pertaining to the 12 technological areas chosen by DIA. In order to accomplish this BAASS contracted with Hal Puthoff, CEO of EarthTech International, with instructions to choose the precise nature and scope of the approximately 38 position papers that would encompass those 12 technical areas.

These 38 position papers would define the “best of the best” aerospace technological performance baseline against which all of the data on UAP technological performance that was incoming from multiple BAASS investigative projects could be measured. It goes without saying that the output from Project Physics, since it dealt with what was “known” in 2008 or projected from known to 2050, was the least controversial and the most “acceptable” of all of the BAASS projects in the eyes of the mainstream intelligence and technology community. 

Little did anyone know at that time that Project Physics was destined to be the very important public face of the AAWSAP contract within DIA. By 2018 and 2019 a lot of the information from Project Physics would leak into public awareness and become the tip of the iceberg in terms of public knowledge of the output from the AAWSAP contract.

Chapter 6: The Dinner and   
Skinwalker Ranch Sequelae

It is entirely possible that behind the perception of our senses, worlds are hidden of which we are unaware.

—Albert Einstein

  


Sometimes a dinner is much more than the meal. So it was with the one that took place in a private room at an upscale Washington, D.C., restaurant. Ostensibly the purpose of the dinner was to meet with the legendary General Paulo Roberto Yog de Miranda UchÔa, who at the time was the Minister for Homeland Security in the Brazilian Government, and his charming daughter, who was a linguist working on contract for the United States Government. 

Although Robert Bigelow, Hal Puthoff, Colm Kelleher, and the BAASS team had met one or two of Jim Lacatski’s extensive network of East Coast Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), the people who showed up to that dinner comprised the A-Team of covert investigative talent across multiple agencies in the United States Government. The individuals in this unique group were all passionately focused on investigating UAPs with consummate professionalism; they also had access to state-of-the-art sensor technology. The dinner was organized by Lacatski and Axelrod; it was the first attempt to bring the Las Vegas and East Coast arms of AAWSAP together. 

In addition to Jim Lacatski, Jonathan Axelrod brought a team of people to the dinner, three of whom were already engaged in an in-depth investigation of the encounter of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group with a Tic Tac-shaped object off the coast of San Diego a few years earlier. By the time of the dinner, Axelrod and his team had already completed most of the pilot and Aegis radar operator interviews. Back then, in 2009, this Tic Tac event, which was to become the most famous UAP event in history, was known to only a very few people at BAASS and some highly specialized military investigators led by Jonathan Axelrod. Also, by the time of the dinner, two of Axelrod’s team, Jim Costigan and David Wilson, as well as Axelrod himself, had visited Skinwalker Ranch and were already experiencing some ranch-aftermath high strangeness events in their homes. 

Further down the dinner table sat Luis Elizondo, who worked collaboratively with Axelrod and was at the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI). Elizondo looked dapper with jet black hair and was considered a brilliant Special Agent and analyst with a lot of expertise on counterintelligence investigations. Little did anyone at that dinner table realize that nine years later Lue Elizondo would become a media star and a household name in global UAP investigations. 

As he enjoyed his steak tartare, Elizondo regaled those around him with some war stories, including one hair-raising exploit about how his advanced intuition and remote viewing capabilities had saved his life and the life of his men while on a covert combat mission in war-torn Afghanistan. Lue was one of that rare breed, an astute, detail-oriented analyst with an open mind. After that dinner meeting and the briefing the following day, he kept in close touch with Jonathan Axelrod as the project progressed.

Opposite Elizondo, looking suave and sophisticated, sat Juliett Witt who was known only by reputation to the BAASS group as a superb Pentagon Operational Test and Evaluation Analyst and DoD Target Sensor Specialist well versed in counterintelligence operations. Witt was a veteran of multiple tours in Russia and Afghanistan and was no stranger to the cloak and dagger rituals of undercover field work. Her position at the Pentagon included membership on multiple interagency task forces that dealt with technical data gathering, so her presence in the group served as the tip of the spear for an extensive network of subject matter experts. 

Conversation at the dinner revolved around a strategy for grappling with, for want of a better term, “the phenomenon.” None of the dinner attendees had any illusions about the subject: it was the most challenging pursuit they had ever engaged in. As Kelleher looked around the table, he was acutely aware that this was a unique gathering of individuals who had four extremely valuable traits in common: an active-duty United States Government affiliation, complete anonymity, technical expertise, and an open mind. Kelleher knew that it was rare for a group with these kinds of talents to focus on a problem as arcane and controversial as this one. 

One of the central conversations at the table revolved around grappling with Skinwalker Ranch. Both Bigelow and Kelleher briefed members of the group on the history of the ranch and on some of the incidents that had happened on the infamous Utah property. At the time of the dinner the BAASS group had already begun making investigative trips to Skinwalker Ranch and the area around it, and in fact most of those present at the dinner had already visited the ranch. Kelleher provided details on the recent research and investigative data gathered in and around the ranch, which left a complete mystery as to who was perpetrating the bizarre incidents. At one end of the dinner table, the sensor experts generated an embryonic list of the most fruitful strategic directions for sensor design and deployment on Skinwalker Ranch as a part of the AAWSAP.

The following day, Axelrod convened a working group in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) to discuss what had already been learned from the Tic Tac case. Axelrod briefed the group for several hours on the extensive interviews that he and his team had already conducted with F/A-18 Hornet pilots, Aegis radar operators, and other eyewitnesses on the Nimitz case. As a part of the briefing, he also showed the now infamous Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) imagery of the Tic Tac object. 

When the subject turned to the Skinwalker Ranch, the group realized that Elizondo and Witt had not yet visited the Skinwalker Ranch and needed to do so. Without hesitation, Witt volunteered to come to Las Vegas, and three weeks later she arrived in Sin City to begin her promised reconnaissance of the Utah property. 

Bigelow, Kelleher, and Witt spent the first night at Bigelow’s corporate headquarters planning the visit and assembling all of the equipment needed for the trip to the ranch the following day. Generation 3-PTV-7 Night Vision binoculars, thermographic imagers and scopes, as well as a variety of cameras were packed into Pelican cases. Witt had also brought some equipment with her. She outlined her intent to the walk as much of the property as possible, both during daylight and at night.

At 8:30 the following morning, Bigelow, Kelleher, and Witt climbed into Bigelow’s luxurious Challenger private jet at McCarran Airport (now Harry Reid International Airport), and within seconds the gleaming jet was taxiing to takeoff. It was the fastest and easiest way to get to Skinwalker Ranch and the beautiful, liminal world of the Utah badlands. 

In less than an hour the jet landed at Vernal Airport, where a white SUV waited to take the trio to the ranch. The airport staff at Vernal Airport did their best to hide their fascination with the legendary aerospace billionaire who regularly touched down at the airport and parked aside the one- and two-seater Cessna and propeller aircraft on the tarmac. Kelleher drove the 30 minutes along US 40 through terrain that was strikingly sparse, thinly populated, and beautiful. Stark red bluffs stood out and Russian Olives and sagebrush were scattered on the properties they drove past. Turning south, the SUV headed through the old garrison town of Fort Duchenne and the headquarters of the Ute reservation. Corrugated Quonset huts and small cinderblock dwellings dotted the small town. Once past the tribal police headquarters the SUV sped up again and within several minutes they were rolling down the dirt road into Skinwalker Ranch.

Witt was silent as they unpacked the SUV and brought the equipment into the command and control, doublewide trailer. The Las Vegas travelers were greeted by the ranch managers, Jean and Richard Dietz, and by two armed security officers who were posted on the property 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Ever since the publication of the Hunt for the Skinwalker in December 2005, the ranch had become the epicenter for thousands of curious UFO and paranormal truth seekers, all eager to camp out near the property in the hopes of witnessing some extraordinary event. The majority of the inquisitive thrill seekers maintained a respectful distance from the land, but occasionally trespassers would wander around, either by accident or by design. The security officers were on the property primarily to accost, capture, and expel trespassers, but they were also under instructions to report any unusual phenomena they witnessed while patrolling. 

After a meal and some downtime, Kelleher and Witt began the tour, walking on the dirt track leading directly west on the property. Kelleher briefed the Pentagon analyst on some of the incidents that had occurred at various points along the way, before they began climbing the 200-foot bluff that formed a natural barrier at the north end of the ranch. Witt took dozens of photographs of the picturesque landscape. The ranch was looking spectacular on this early fall day, the green pastures and the fully bloomed trees lent a stark contrast to the red sandstone rock-strewn landscape of Skinwalker Ridge. The pair continued west past Homestead 2, where Kelleher continued briefing her on the incidents that had occurred around the old, abandoned buildings since 1996. 

At the western border of the ranch, which was about a mile and half from the Command and Control trailer, Kelleher and Witt came upon an assortment of dried deer skins and animal skulls hanging on stakes in a field on the adjacent property. An assortment of carcasses of dead cattle and at least one relatively recently dead horse lay scattered around the small pasture. Witt was silent as she slowly surveyed this macabre display of multi-species carnage. The gruesome spectacle made her wonder if this was an innocent dumping of unwanted carcasses from adjacent properties, or some opaque message being communicated by unknown individuals?

![](../Images/image00149.jpeg)

Outwardly unperturbed, Juliett Witt continued taking several high-definition photos of the scene, after which they headed back towards the east end of the property. The sun was still high in the sky as they walked again through the 100-year-old, broken-down buildings that comprised the second homestead. The two dogs that accompanied the pair chased good naturedly after any hint of small wildlife in the area. Other than turkey buzzards wheeling high overhead, there was nothing sinister in the atmosphere that gave any indication of the dozens of cattle that had been savagely mutilated on the property, the bizarre silent flying blue orbs, or the metallic UFOs that had stalked the landscape in the past few years. 

Several hours later, between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m., Bigelow, Kelleher, and Witt began their walk towards Homestead 2 accompanied again by the two dogs. The moon was high in the sky and cast a lot of light over the landscape so the trio could walk easily without flashlights or night vision technology. The purpose of the foray was to conduct a night watch on the property to observe and, if possible, record any unusual phenomena. Kelleher had spent hundreds of days and nights on Skinwalker ranch and knew that more than 98 percent of the time these night watches were uneventful. 

The trio reached the small pasture that lay south of Homestead 2 and then walked about 50 yards to the location where multiple individuals had seen and recorded anomalies in years past. The small pasture was about 200 feet wide, a couple hundred yards long, and was lined with 50-foot high Russian Olive trees. 

They sat on foldable chairs back-to-back so that a full 360 field of view was visible to them. The silence was intense. With the exception of the two dogs running in the adjacent pasture nothing moved. At one point, Kelleher noticed that Witt was stirring uneasily in her chair and was beginning to breathe quickly. She was a seasoned and well-trained DIA analyst, and she had been on multiple tours that had involved danger on many levels, but she was still unprepared for being a “sitting duck” in a paranormal Disneyland waiting for whatever chose to come out of the night. 

![](../Images/image00150.jpeg)

After about an hour of uneasy silence listening to Witt’s rapid breathing, Kelleher and Bigelow got up to explore the perimeter. Witt protested at being left alone and quickly joined Kelleher as he headed towards the west side of the old, abandoned homestead. Bigelow was about a hundred yards south of the pair and could hear the dogs several hundred yards away. 

Suddenly a cone of silence descended on Kelleher and Witt; the crickets seemed to go silent and even the faint rustling of the breeze in the trees ceased. Turning around, they saw a creature ambling towards them from the south. It was the size of a 150-pound pig and should have been making considerable noise as it walked. Yet, the cone of silence dominated the moonlit scene as the creature glided past within 30 feet of Kelleher and about 50 feet from Witt. To Kelleher, it appeared the animal had a series of dinosaur-like spines on its back and also sported a very large, flattened beaver-like tail. It noiselessly coasted past the pair and disappeared around the southwestern corner of the building, still not making a sound. Even Kelleher, who had spent hundreds of days and nights on Skinwalker Ranch and had already been exposed to his fair share of bizarre anomalies on the property, felt a distinct chill as he watched the surreal animal shuffle silently away.

Kelleher looked at Witt, who was staring in astonishment at where they had last seen the creature. Quickly, as if a spell had been broken, they hurried around the corner to get another look at the bizarre beast. Nothing was visible. Witt and Kelleher then ran to the north end of the homestead, and still there was no sign of the creature. Ten minutes later, the pair were still searching feverishly in the area when Bigelow joined them. 

The freakish hybrid of small dinosaur and large beaver had silently and suddenly appeared out of the night in the pasture and had just as silently disappeared without leaving any trace. There had been no time to take photographs, and once again Kelleher was left feeling baffled and frustrated. It was after 2:00 a.m. and Witt appeared subdued as they made their way back to the trailer to turn in for the night. 

The following morning, Kelleher discovered that the shaken analyst had insisted on having a security officer sleep on a couch outside her room with her bedroom door open and lights in the living room fully illuminated for the entire night. The nighttime visit to Homestead 2 on the ranch had deeply affected Witt, and she continued to process the experience the next day. The trio left the ranch on schedule later that afternoon and within a couple of hours had landed back at McCarran airport. 

Witt was now back to her ebullient self. As Kelleher drove her back to her hotel on the Strip, she promised to keep in touch and to send the scores of high-definition photographs she had taken. Witt also confided in Kelleher that she had taken several sprigs of sage and heather from the property, partly as a memento of her memorable visit but also because she had a deep affinity for heather and sage.

A few weeks later Bigelow and Kelleher learned that Witt’s eventful visit to the ranch was only the beginning of an invasion of frightening phenomena that penetrated her normally quiet and serene Virginia townhouse. Within a week of arriving back home, Witt told Kelleher that her roommate suddenly began screaming in fear at about 2:00 a.m. She heard him yelling in the adjacent room that somebody was standing over his bed. She quickly activated all of the lights and found that there was nobody in his room. It took hours for the roommate to calm down. 

In her first conversation with Kelleher, Witt explained that she had lived in that townhouse for a couple of years and that nothing like that had ever happened. She also reported hearing loud banging sounds from her kitchen and heavy footsteps on her stairs the previous night. She confessed that her roommate’s hysterical reaction to this paranormal invasion was more frightening than the actual event itself.

A week later, she again called Kelleher to report that on the previous night she was slowly backing out of her driveway when a gigantic bird that looked like an over-sized owl had swooped down and literally attacked her car. Twice the huge bird of prey had dived down at high speed, the creature’s talons striking her windshield and her hood with great force. It was only after jamming her foot on the gas that she avoided another attack from the owl. Witt reported that she had never seen an owl that big, and she certainly had never experienced that kind of aggressive attack from any kind of bird. Witt sounded very disturbed as there were definite scrapes and gouges in the paint on her car. At the time (2009), she was completely unaware of the perceived relationship in the world of paranormal research between owls and UAPs, although by 2015, Mike Clelland and others had already signposted this link.4

A month later Axelrod called Kelleher with some very sobering news. It appeared that the poltergeist activity had escalated in Witt’s townhouse, and that on one occasion both Witt and her roommate were in the living room when two wine bottles suddenly flew off the wine rack, hurtled across the room in front of them, and smashed loudly and messily on the opposite wall. Axelrod told Kelleher that Witt’s roommate was so terrified by the litany of paranormal events that he had moved out of the townhouse. Although the intensity and frequency of the attacks then decreased, they were still relatively common. Witt reported that she frequently awoke to find black shadow-like figures in her room near her bed, and she reported seeing different colored orbs in her home. 

Witt was adamant that she had never experienced any events of this kind in her townhouse before her visit to Skinwalker Ranch. It was if she had “brought something back” from Skinwalker Ranch to her quiet, affluent Virginia neighborhood. 

Several years later, Witt was still experiencing the poltergeist-like activity in her townhouse.

But Witt was not the only one to report “bringing something back” with them after visiting Skinwalker Ranch. By the end of the BAASS program, this phenomenon had escalated to alarming levels, often with medically deleterious consequences.

Chapter 7: Lagol California Investigation

And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.

—Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil

  


Lagol is a small community in Ventura County, California. Immediately following the 4th of July 2009 holiday, all hell broke loose on a 20-acre property in the middle of the township. During this period of high strangeness, four separate witnesses were involved. 

The Scarsdale family was relaxing out on the porch of their large ranch home on the evening of July 5. “It was approximately 9:20 at night,” according to family patriarch, Buck Scarsdale, a retired law enforcement detective with approximately 25 years of experience. “It was a beautiful evening,” he recalled. “It was warm. A bright moon. We were on the front porch just sitting around talking. I came into the house to get a cup of coffee and I was walking northwest toward the coffee pot. The kitchen lights were off. I immediately noticed seven huge lights outside. That were just a weird blue that I have never ever seen before. Bizarre. It, it looked like a new BMW or an LED light magnified by one hundred. That bright. And so I came in and saw the lights and first thing I’m thinking is: man, that’s a lot of lights. Someone is trying to steal my orchard plants.” Scarsdale hurried back to the porch and saw that his girlfriend, Joanna Fife, and son Bo were staring at the intense blue lights. Both asked in unison: “What are those lights”? All seven lights appeared to be stationary and several feet above the ground in their orchard about 500 feet away. There was no sound. 

The trio became concerned that a brazen group of people had driven a large, brightly lit trailer into the middle of their orchard to steal some of their expensive, award-winning fruit trees. After staring at the motionless lights for another three or four minutes, they jumped in their red truck and drove slowly with lights off in the direction of the lights. A few minutes later, they noticed, as they drove slowly into the area, that all of the lights were gone. They had just vanished. Nobody had seen them blink off and nobody had seen a large object moving out of the orchard. 

The Scarsdales were perplexed. Buck later told the AAWSAP BAASS interviewers: “If it would have hovered and moved away, we would have seen that. We would have seen something. And we saw absolutely nothing. By now I’m kinda freaked out. There’s only one way in this ranch and one way out.” 

They drove around to the back gate of the property and confirmed that the gate was still closed and padlocked. There was no sign of anything unusual in the area, so they returned to the house to discuss the strange happening. After 20 minutes, they agreed to return to the area, and this time they each carried powerful flashlights. When they reached the orchard, they turned the engine off and switched off the lights. 

They walked cautiously around the area looking for tire tracks or any disturbance. After 10 minutes of searching, all three froze when a loud click broke the silence. It seemed to be very close, but there was no obvious source. “What was that?” Bo muttered, but received no answer. A second loud click reverberated like a pistol shot coming from dense bushes about 20 yards away. The click did not seem mechanical and was completely different from a branch snapping. It was unlike anything they had heard before. 

All three were on their hands and knees now, crawling slowly in the direction of the thick bush line. A third click sounded, this time several yards behind them. 

They later admitted that the hairs were standing on the backs of their necks. They looked behind them but could still see nothing, even with the bright illumination from the moon. Yet another loud click, this time from a different direction. On the fifth click, as if in unison, all three hurried out of there and headed for their vehicle. They had had enough. 

Back on the porch of their home, Buck got a message from his brother, Roger, that he was on his way over to the property after a social function. Buck was pleased because Roger was by far the most educated in the family with a doctorate in international law and a slew of other qualifications. Buck knew that Roger was a diehard skeptic, and he was sure that his educated brother would provide a logical explanation for the bizarre events that had happened a few hours previously. 

Roger arrived at about 10:30 p.m. and listened to his family excitedly recount the happenings of the previous few hours. His first and immediate desire was to revisit the scene, so within minutes Buck and Roger were walking the 500 feet or so from the porch slowly towards center of the orchard. Buck and Roger reached the area just before 11:00 p.m. where the three had heard the mysterious “clicking” sounds. As they were looking around, Roger saw a silver, grey, and blue flash disappear into an opening in the sky. Roger said, in a numbed, deadpan voice, “That doesn’t happen.” 

Roger stood gazing speechless. Although it happened quickly, Roger later told investigators that the sky “literally opened and a blue flash occurred as an oblong object appeared to enter the opening which then closed swiftly.” Roger continued looking at the same area of the sky and reported seeing a swirling, bluish “residue.” As the enormity of what he had seen hit him, he leaned over to his brother and hoarsely whispered “let’s get the fuck out of here.” 

Unlike Roger, Buck had only caught sight of the bright flash out of the corner of his eye. As they walked back in silence, Roger began to talk about “wormholes” as the closest thing to what he had seen in the sky. Buck was amazed at the change in his brother’s demeanor since the event. Buck also noticed that his cellphone had lost its charge; the device remained impossible to charge the following day.

Roger later told investigators that it was one of the most amazing things he has ever seen, and when he was recounting the event, he appeared to be completely unnerved by the experience.

When the family members were interviewed separately, each reported feeling a lot of stress in the days after the incidents. Buck began smoking for the first time in many years and found that he could not sleep. He felt intensely lethargic and did not shave for at least five days. 

On July 10 just after midnight Buck came downstairs into the kitchen and saw a single large, intensely blue light about a third of a mile away out on the northern end of the pasture. The light looked like it was close to the ground. He called Bo and Joanna into the kitchen and they both confirmed seeing the light. As Buck and Bo stepped onto the patio, the light dimmed abruptly. Upon closer questioning by AAWSAP BAASS interviewers, all three thought they could see a vague structure behind and close to the light. One witness likened the barely visible structure to a wall. As before, there was no sound associated with the object.

They began to move across the porch to better observe the light. As soon as they stepped off the porch, the light suddenly disappeared. Fifteen minutes later Roger arrived, and within a few minutes Buck and Roger walked out onto the pasture to look for tracks on the ground where the bright light had vanished. Joanna and Bo stayed on the porch. As the brothers walked the pasture, the bright light suddenly appeared in front of them, but neither Joanna nor Bo saw anything from the porch. Buck and Roger stood silently in the pasture and watched the floating light, estimated to be about five feet in diameter and 300 yards away, for another five minutes after which it suddenly vanished. Rather than emanating from some source (like a flashlight or a headlight), this bright light appeared to Roger to be “self-contained,” as if there was no source producing the light. 

Both men stopped off at their two-horse corral on the way back to the porch. Both horses were extremely and uncharacteristically wild that night. They were bucking and whinnying loudly as if a predator was in the corral with them. It took Buck and Roger a good while to calm the horses down. Buck and Roger suspected that the horses’ behavior might be linked to the unusual light that night. 

Site Visit 

The AAWSAP BAASS program managers heard about the high strangeness activity on the Lagol property through MUFON Project Manager Richard Lang. AAWSAP and MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) had developed a collaborative arrangement and their relationship evolved into a highly efficient enterprise with open line communications and a very productive working alliance. Since the details of this case met the pre-arranged threshold for engagement by AAWSAP BAASS, it was decided that a team would conduct a site visit.

So on July 13, an AAWSAP BAASS team comprised of three investigators with law enforcement experience was deployed on a preliminary fact gathering site visit from Las Vegas to the Scarsdale property. The team spent most of the day walking, photographing, and mapping the 20-acre property. Over the next two days the team recorded separate interviews with each of the four witnesses. While they were on the property, the team also conducted night watches on July 13 and 14. The investigators saw nothing out of the ordinary while on the property. When the AAWSAP team left on July 15, Buck Scarsdale felt the family could put the bizarre, and still unexplained, events behind them. 

But two nights later, on July 17, Buck was abruptly awakened at 11:45 p.m. He was, in his words, “compelled” to get up, walk over to his bedroom window, and look out in a northwesterly direction. Two large blue lights were out in the pasture hovering approximately 25-30 feet off the ground. Later, he estimated the lights were about 25 feet apart. Buck quickly ran downstairs, grabbed his Motorola 1880 cellphone, and rushed outside onto the porch to try to record whatever was on his land. Buck thought that he had obtained approximately 30 seconds of video of the lights on his cellphone so he called his brother Roger to come over and look at the footage.

Roger arrived about 45 minutes later and together they replayed the 30-second video clip. Slowly they realized that there was a solid object between the two lights. The object was hovering about 25 off the ground with the two bright lights on either end. It appeared to have a flattened bottom and a hatch on top. Roger suggested that he drive their truck down to the exact location where Buck had filmed the lights while Buck would film him sitting in the truck with the headlights on as a way of baselining or re-enacting the event. 

Roger sat in the truck for 15 minutes and Buck remained on the patio and filmed the scene for 30–45 seconds. Half an hour later, the two brothers reviewed the short clip-on Buck’s phone. They were bewildered to see two small, brightly lit red orbs moving in unison above the truck as Roger sat there blissfully unaware. The video footage also showed what appeared to be a pair of thin “legs” in the truck’s headlights. Closer examination indicated that a small humanoid with head, torso, two arms, and thin legs had been briefly illuminated by the headlight beams. 

The two brothers were then joined by Bo and Joanna, and all four stayed up to 5:00 a.m. obsessively playing and replaying the footage. When they compared the video that Buck had taken of the two lights out in the field with the footage of Roger sitting in the truck, it was very apparent that there was a fundamental qualitative difference between the lights on the “craft” versus those on the truck. The craft lights were brighter but were not projecting light beams like the truck headlights. Rather, Roger’s description of the two lights was that they appeared to be “self-contained” without any projection of light.

Sometime during the intense four-hour period, Joanna locked the footage on the Motorola phone so that it could not be deleted. Later, all four admitted to a profound uneasiness and a reluctance to go to sleep. The family finally got to sleep after 5:00 a.m. Before he retired, Buck put his cellphone on the charger.

Both brothers awoke at 8:00 a.m. and began reviewing the footage again. To their astonishment all of the files on the cellphone had been deleted. In addition to the recent video footage, dozens of files of Buck’s vacation trips and holiday snaps had also been deleted. Nothing remained on the device except Buck’s list of contact phone numbers.

On July 23 a second team of three AAWSAP BAASS investigators arrived at the location to conduct additional surveillance and to re-interview the eyewitnesses. During the first night watch a Sony HDR SR10 camcorder was set up west of the Scarsdale residence pointing northwest toward the location of the most frequent sightings. Meanwhile, the three investigators were deployed on the property for a night watch between 8:30 p.m. and 5:30 a.m. 

By 9:30 p.m. the AAWSAP BAASS investigators saw lights to the west as all three trained their night vision googles (NVGs) in that direction. All separately verified seeing a series of six to eight brightly lit circular orbs that were estimated to be about two miles away. All the objects were moving and formed different transient patterns in the sky, ranging from a straight line with all eight objects parallel to the ground to a tightly clustered formation. The brightly lit spheres appeared to be synchronized, as they would line up vertically, horizontally, circle around each other, and then depart in different directions. The sighting lasted more than a minute before the objects abruptly disappeared. At no time were the brightly illuminated, fast moving objects visible with the naked eye. 

The AAWSAP BAASS investigators continued the routine of all-night surveillance. Each time the Sony HDR SR10 camcorder was deployed in record mode, and each time prior to the night watch the investigators verified that the camcorder was recording. Then on July 27 at 9:00 p.m. “Investigator One” noticed the camcorder was not functioning in the record mode. An operational check was conducted, and Investigator One alerted his colleagues that the camera had been manually switched from Record Mode to Demonstration Mode. The only way for this to happen was for someone to physically switch the setting, and Investigator One had been standing within 30 feet of the camera the entire time. As he examined the device for clues to how this could have happened, Investigator One noticed that the camcorder had taken a series of photograph-like images, portraying unknown, unidentified objects.

At about 9:30 that night, Buck Scarsdale became very excited as he reported seeing a black object with no lights hovering silently over one of his greenhouses about 300 yards from his residence. He was using a pair of the Generation III NVGs borrowed from the AAWSAP BAASS team. Buck yelled at the other investigators to train their NVGs on the area, but they could not confirm his sighting. Scarsdale described seeing through the NVG a small hovering craft, some 20 or 30 feet long with a flat bottom.

About an hour later, at 10:15 p.m., Investigator Two was sweeping the area with his Generation III NVGs when he saw what appeared to be a “craft” hovering silently over the pasture in the same location as the bright lights seen by the Scarsdales on July 5 and on July 11. According to Investigator Two’s after-action report and subsequent debriefing, the “craft was 30’ wide, 20’ in height, a curved top, the sides of the craft angled inward, from the bottom to the top, and the bottom of the craft was flat. It appeared through the NVGs as a flat black color and there were no visible lights or markings on the craft.” The object was not seen with the naked eye. Attempts to capture the object on video also failed. It vanished from the NVG’s field of view after about 15 seconds. The object that Investigator Two had seen appeared to closely resemble what Buck Scarsdale had excitedly reported about an hour previously.

Immediately following this July 27 sighting, multiple photos of different vantage points, both on and off the Scarsdale property, were taken by the AAWSAP BAASS investigators. During that active period on the property, several unexplained anomalies were captured on camera. All of these photos were submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency and accompanied the 257-page report that was written and delivered to DIA on the Lagol California incidents (see Appendix I). 

Battery Drainage

The Scarsdale family reported that their cellphones and other equipment were frequently subjected to unexplained battery drainages, sudden loss of signal, and equipment failure during the periods when anomalies were occurring on their property. 

The AAWSAP BAASS equipment also experienced several battery drainage and equipment failures on the Lagol property. For example, while attempting to capture in situ soil analysis data with a portable Thermo Fisher Niton X-Ray Florescence analytical instrument that is capable of recording the quantitative elemental composition of soil—for Mo, Zr, Sr, U, Rb, Th, Pb, Se, As, Hg, Au, Zn, W, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, Ti, Sc, Ca, K, Ba, Cs, Te, Sb, Sn, Cd, Ag, and Pd—several electronic anomalies occurred. On multiple occasions, the Niton’s freshly charged and checked batteries drained abruptly. After multiple failed attempts to recharge the Niton instrument, the soil samples were eventually taken and brought back to Las Vegas for subsequent elemental analysis. 

Secondly, the Aaronia Spectran HF-60100 1MHz to 9.4GHz Handheld Spectrum Analyzer had previously been successfully used on multiple AAWSAP BAASS trips to different locations to obtain measurement of electric and magnetic fields. The HF-60100 spectrum analyzer had proven to be a rugged, reliable instrument not given to failures. Almost as soon as the HF-60100 was deployed on the Scarsdale property, the power drained. Between July 24-29, power fluctuations and power drainages occurred frequently. The HF-60100 analyzer functioned perfectly when it was taken off property and tested at a nearby hotel. 

The Lagol property phenomena were real. They had been witnessed by four separate Scarsdale family members and all three investigators. The timeline of events, as submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency, included:

  * Seven blue lights appearing like portholes, 07/05/09 at 2120 hours.
  * Clicking noises, 07/05/09 at 2145 hours.
  * Flash of light with possible aircraft entering it and disappearing, 07/05/09 at 2300 hours.
  * One blue light appearing like a porthole, 07/11/09 at 0020 hours.
  * Mr. Scarsdale being woken up and compelled to go outside, 07/17/09 at 2345 hours.
  * Two blue lights with possible craft. Video obtained, 07/17/09 at 2345 hours.
  * Red orbs and gray figure in video of truck, 07/18/09 at 0015 hours.
  * Video being erased, 07/18/09, unknown time, approximately 0030 hours-0800 hours.
  * Six to eight lights/orbs in the sky, 07/24/09 at 2130 hours.
  * Camera changing to demo mode and video being erased, 07/27/09 at 2105 hours.
  * Dark craft like object in sky, 07/27/09 at 2120 hours.
  * Photos taken depicting contrails and images of faces, 07/27/09 at 2300 hours.



Throughout the month of July 2009, all four Scarsdale witnesses reported intermittent unexplained incidents, like hearing the refrigerator door open and close when nobody was in the kitchen, doors opening and closing at night when everybody was in bed, and unexplained flashes of light on the property and in the house. Of course, similar low-level poltergeist activity had been a signature of the Skinwalker Ranch phenomena over decades of investigation involving dozens of people.

Chapter 8: Blue Orbs Are Not Benign

A ball of light appeared in their home . . . shortly after the flying saucer sighting, it first appeared in the older sister’s bedroom, it went down the hall and appeared in my mother and dad’s bedroom . . . 

—Kim Arnold, daughter of Kenneth Arnold, relating the appearance of a ball of light/orb in the Arnold home shortly after her father’s history-making sighting on June 24, 19475

  


Within nine months after signing the contract with the DIA in September 2008, BAASS had successfully hired a team of over 50 people to investigate, analyze, collate, and translate UAP cases both in the United States and globally. Out of the dozens of cases for which BAASS sent investigators as “boots on the ground,” a few stand out as examples of how BAASS broke new ground in terms of thoroughness, deployment, and use of investigators and equipment. The following is yet another example that exemplifies the AAWSAP BAASS focus on in-depth investigations.

Blue Orbs in Oregon

The following details are summarized from an onsite face-to-face interview conducted by Colm Kelleher and BAASS contract physician Norbert Black, as well as from numerous follow-up telephone conversations. The incident happened to a brilliant 48-year-old biotechnologist named Ron Becker (not his real name) and his daughter as they were driving 50 miles southeast of Bend, Oregon, on Highway 20 on the night of May 1, 2005. Becker was driving a rental car to visit his brother. 

Since it was a long trip, and he was trying to arrive at his brother’s house in Bend at a reasonable hour, Becker was traveling fast, 85 mph. He explained that he routinely drives at this speed when travelling long distances. Becker said the road was deserted when the incident happened.

Becker’s daughter was in the passenger seat with the seat back in the reclined position, when she noticed three bright blue objects flying about a hundred yards away in a nearby field. The objects were making random zig zags around each other with no apparent purpose. As the younger Becker watched in puzzlement, the three bright blue orbs began moving quickly towards their car. Within seconds, two of the three small round objects flew directly through the vehicle. One passed across the dashboard in front of father and daughter before exiting the car through the window. As the younger Becker watched in horror, the second orb entered the upper left arm of the father, passed through his upper body at chest level and exited his body at the level of his bicep. The daughter had witnessed the exit of the blue orb from her father’s shoulder.

As the BAASS scientists debriefed Becker, he remembered feeling a sense of movement as the blue orb entered his body; he knew that something bizarre was occurring—everything seemed to become blurred and hazy. He recalled being fixated on the horrified expression on his daughter’s face. After the orb exited his right upper arm, he looked up in time to see the bright blue ball moving away from his car at a distance of about 100 feet. He judged it to be about the size of a softball, clearly shaped like a sphere, with sharply defined outlines. In a follow-up interview, the younger Becker remembered that the two blue balls that entered the car were slightly different shades of blue, one darker than the other.

Within minutes of the incident, while still driving quickly, Becker began to feel ill (nausea and general malaise) and very scared; too scared to stop driving. According to both occupants, something strange occurred during that time; the 45-minute segment of the trip to Bend appeared to take three hours. Eventually, they arrived at his brother’s house, and because Ron was attending a conference in the morning, he went straight to bed. 

While asleep, Becker had a very unusual and vivid dream. He recalled an unusual face surrounded by light saying to him “Okay, we are going to fix this,” while a finger in front of the face applied pressure on his left shoulder.

Four hours later, he awoke feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. He then left his brother’s house to attend the weekend-long biotechnology conference, as scheduled. But Becker remembered feeling dizzy and at times nauseous during the meetings. Shortly after the conference ended, he noticed an intense red rash on the left side of his face. He also noticed that he was losing hair from the front left side of his head (hairline and eyebrow). Becker became progressively unwell. Even his ankles were swelling. During this period, he reported diminishing visual acuity in his left eye as well as decreased hearing in his left ear. 

In the weeks following the blue orb incident, he quickly began to gain weight, despite carefully watching his diet and working out once a day. Becker felt increasingly unwell. He had no energy and slept a lot. So he hired a personal trainer and began focusing on the gym. He totally eliminated sugar from his diet, but still the weight gain continued to 200 pounds. Before the incident, he weighed 155 pounds. 

In the two-year period following the incident, serial blood samples taken from Ron Becker showed pronounced abnormalities in his hematological parameters. His most serious medical complaint was a diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) in his left chest in February 2007. Although extremely rare in men, Becker’s physician was certain of the diagnosis. He underwent surgery on May 14, 2007. A biopsy of his lymph nodes indicated that the cancer had not metastasized. 

He received no chemotherapy or radiation treatments following his surgery. A whole-body scan done in July 2007 revealed no apparent metastases thus improving his long-term survival outlook. By late 2008, Becker reported that his health appeared to be slowly improving, although he still complained of moderate to severe pain and almost continuous fatigue. 

By the end of 2008, his main focus was to try to get his career back on track after three years of continuous ill health. This formerly vibrant man ascribed his three-year ordeal directly to the invasion of the blue orb into his body. 

Becker’s case was one of the most thoroughly documented anomaly encounter cases in history. Dozens of separate blood parameter measurements were taken, both before and after the May 1, 2005, event. This unusually thorough medical documentation allowed BAASS to make definitive statements regarding the patient’s blood chemistry. There was a dramatic change in his white blood cell counts following the incident: his lymphocyte count progressively decreased while his neutrophil count progressively increased over the two-year period following the incident. And neither type of blood cells showed any signs of returning to normal levels even two years after the blue orb incident. 

From a general perspective, there are multiple questions surrounding this case, the most obvious being: is there a cause-and-effect relationship between the 2005 incident and the dramatic change in this man’s health? Ron Becker had been a highly active, productive, and high-energy individual. Both his son and his daughter were concerned by the deterioration of Ron’s health. 

Although it is presently impossible to ascribe the patient’s carcinoma directly to the incident, it did not escape the notice of the BAASS group that the path of the blue orb through the man’s body was not inconsistent with damage to his chest and subsequent extremely rare but aggressive cancer. Secondly, it was the opinion of the consulting BAASS physicians, both of whom are experienced diagnosticians, that the 18-month timeframe for the development of this aggressive cancer beginning with the incident in May 2005 and culminating in the diagnosis in February 2007 is biologically consistent with a cause-and-effect temporal relationship. 

Like all cancers, DCIS in men is a multistep process involving multiple genetic changes, including silencing of tumor suppressor genes along with the activation of oncogenes and culminating in the emergence of the malignant clone. Development of DCIS, in line with most cancers, has been correlated with a wide variety of environmental insults, including radiation. In this context, both BAASS consulting physicians remarked that Becker’s early reported symptoms immediately following his encounter with the blue orb, including extreme nausea, hair loss, and skin rash were all consistent with a radiation insult. Attempts to identify cytogenetic abnormalities in the circulating population of Becker’s T- lymphocytes approximately two years after the blue orb event were unsuccessful, although too few cells were examined in the test to make a convincing scientific judgment.

The BAASS group concluded that there was enough circumstantial evidence to indicate that the sudden passage of the blue orb through his body had had an adverse effect on the man’s physiology at multiple levels and hence was a direct threat to his health. 

BAASS scientists and analysts spent considerable time attempting to derive and construct evidentiary matrices to decide whether the passage of the blue orb through Becker’s body was a deliberate act that targeted him, or alternatively whether he, his daughter, and their vehicle were simply “in the wrong place at the wrong time” on that day in May 2005. 

Two interviews with Becker’s daughter elicited her memory that when she first noticed the three orbs, they were “playing together” in the field adjacent to the highway. Then, once she noticed them, the three orbs instantly changed direction and began flying towards their car, two of them subsequently flying directly through the left window of the car. 

Do Becker’s daughter’s recollections provide any evidence for a deliberate act on the part of the orbs, or was the interaction a purely fortuitous and “random” event? 

It should be noted that Becker’s daughter remained healthy after this incident, but “something” seemed to follow her back to her home in Connecticut. There, in the home she shared with three college friends, she experienced a plethora of paranormal events. Her roommates began reporting episodes of awakening to see dark shadowy figures standing over their beds, heavy footsteps ascending and descending the stairs, and bizarre poltergeist activity. This activity went on for over two years in the Connecticut household after Ron Becker’s blue orb incident.

Blue Orbs on Skinwalker Ranch

Many of the AAWSAP BAASS group were more than familiar with the blue orb incidents that had taken place on Skinwalker Ranch from 1994 to 2000. These incidents were documented in the book Hunt for the Skinwalker, and as the NIDS investigators previously described, most interactions between blue orbs and humans and animals are usually not benign in nature. Just prior to NIDS purchasing the Skinwalker Ranch in September 1996, there were two serious incidents with blue orbs on Skinwalker Ranch, both involving the rancher and his wife (pseudonym The Gormans). 

The first incident happened a few months before the rancher sold the property to Robert Bigelow. So traumatic was this incident that it was instrumental in the family’s decision to sell the property and ultimately move to a different state. During one evening in May of 1996, as Gorman was outside with his dogs, he noticed a baseball-sized blue orb maneuvering close to the ground in the large field beside his homestead. He sent his three dogs after it. One of the dogs got close to the blue orb, leaping and snapping at it, but the orb dodged just out of reach—it appeared to be under intelligent control. The blue orb, still flying close to the ground, disappeared into an area with a lot of undergrowth and trees with the three dogs in hot pursuit. Shortly afterwards, the rancher heard a series of high-pitched yelps and then silence. The following morning, he went down to the area and discovered three round areas of very dried out vegetation with three black greasy lumps in the middle of each circle. The rancher presumed that his three dogs had been incinerated. The dogs were never seen again. 

The second incident on the ranch was much closer and more personal. The Gormans were enjoying a beautiful sunset just outside their homestead on a summer evening in 1996 when they noticed a blue orb circling a horse’s head in the field less than a hundred yards away. The horse was impatiently flicking its head away from the orb as it circled within a few inches of its head. Suddenly, the orb flew directly towards the rancher and his wife, then halted about 10 feet above and in front of them. As the blue orb hovered above them, they got a very clear view of it. In interviews, both remembered that the orb was a glass-like object about the size of a baseball, with two different bubbling blue liquids mixing and rotating inside. 

The object appeared to emit a sound like the faint crackling of “static electricity.” As they watched, fascinated, their apprehension slowly escalated into fear. Neither said a word to the other. Their fear quickly became unbearable. They were now drenched in sweat. 

Almost automatically, in a desperate bid for survival, the rancher’s wife snapped on the flashlight, and in a lightning reaction the blue orb darted off into a nearby tree, maneuvering away at high speed to avoid the stabbing beam of the flashlight. The orb began swiftly moving through the branches with superbly tight, sophisticated maneuvers. Both ranchers were convinced that the object was under intelligent control. 

With the orb now a distance away, the Gormans felt their terror begin to diminish. Their heart rates began to slow, and the pumping flow of adrenaline began to subside. Within 20 minutes they were both back to normal, but the memory of that intense fear would remain with them for a long time. Both were adamant that there really was no rational reason for the level of visceral terror that they had experienced. The couple later speculated that the blue orbs were technological devices that were capable of manipulating the level of fear in the human body.

Blue Orb in Maryland

We next turn our attention to an event that took place in a highly populated area in urban Maryland.

Two months after the July 2009 incident Jim Costigan had experienced at Skinwalker Ranch (see Chapter 1), life in his home in suburban Maryland had returned to normal. Then on a balmy September evening, Costigan, his wife, Laila, and their dog left their home just after 10:00 p.m. for their nightly two-mile dog walk. It was slightly humid and quite warm, but all three were enjoying the leisurely stroll around the quiet suburb. It was late enough that most of their neighbors were indoors.

“What the heck is that?” murmured Laila. She had stopped walking and was fixating on something she had seen over Costigan’s left shoulder. He turned and took in a sharp breath. About 20 yards away, a blue orb was moving in their direction. It was no more than six feet off the ground, bright blue, softball-sized, and completely silent. Without warning it accelerated and quickly shot between them, barely grazing Laila’s shoulder as it passed. She did not feel the fast-moving object as it passed, but Costigan was certain it was no more than an inch from Laila’s shoulder. The orb continued in a straight line and within seconds was lost behind a house. Their dog appeared not to have noticed the orb.

There was a stunned silence, Costigan and his wife just looking at each other. Nothing stirred in the sleepy neighborhood. Costigan swallowed hard and asked her if she was okay. She nodded without speaking, appearing distracted. They then walked back home in silence. Laila had heard some of the anecdotes from Skinwalker Ranch, but he had never described anything in detail to her. Costigan felt a deep sense of unease as the couple prepared for bed. The Costigans had owned their house for several years and had never experienced anything even slightly out of the ordinary, either inside their home or in the neighborhood, before his visit to Skinwalker Ranch. 

Costigan’s friend and colleague, Jonathan Axelrod, who had visited the ranch at the same time, had recently begun telling Costigan about some bizarre happenings at his home. Axelrod was adamant that his trip to Skinwalker Ranch had unleashed a paranormal firestorm on his family. This fact made Costigan doubly uneasy. He and Laila both slept late the day following their blue orb encounter. When she got up, Laila observed that her body hurt. She had a headache and was experiencing flu symptoms. It was a given in the family that the superbly athletic and very fit Laila simply never got sick. 

Costigan left for work promising to check with Laila later in the day. But he couldn’t reach her when he called, and when he got home, he found her lying listlessly in bed with no energy and a severe headache. In the days that followed, Laila called in sick and took some flu medicine, but her symptoms persisted. A week later she went to the doctor. Multiple tests were run and several vials of her blood were taken. Laila remained lethargic, her joints were increasingly painful, and she regularly complained of feeling unwell. Two weeks later all the tests were back. At the meeting with her primary physician, Costigan could tell that the doctor was at a loss to explain what had happened to his wife. 

After dozens of additional doctor visits, including neurologists, immunologists, and other specialists, Laila’s constellation of bizarre symptoms was eventually diagnosed. She had Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis—an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. His wife has been on medication ever since. Costigan is adamant that the development of her autoimmune disease was a direct consequence of her close encounter with the blue orb.

Chapter 9: Bringing Something Home—The Infectious Agent Model

We don’t like to talk about the hitchhiker too much because everybody’s afraid it’s going to trigger it or something. I have several colleagues that were putting instruments out to measure things at their house, as well as at the ranch. And we’re measuring simultaneous events occurring at both places. That may be a thousand miles apart. 

—Dr. Travis Taylor, lead investigator on   
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch6

  


Most people who spent more than a day on Skinwalker Ranch brought “something” home with them from the property. The effect was almost universal, and universally unpleasant. Even during the NIDS days when Kelleher and Eric Davis spent literally hundreds of days on night watches on Skinwalker Ranch (1996–1999), their wives would occasionally remark waking up at night and seeing “people” in their bedrooms, or black shadows walking through the house. These post-ranch events were noticeable, but mild, during the NIDS years. But they escalated dramatically with the AAWSAP BAASS program at the ranch in 2009. 

All five actively serving intelligence agency personnel who visited the ranch during the AAWSAP BAASS program experienced profound anomalies while on the property. And even more importantly, all five brought something home with them. 

Jonathan Axelrod and his family are the “poster children” for the eruption of anomalies in the home following trips to Skinwalker Ranch (Chapter 1). For more than a dozen years following his July 2009 and subsequent trips to the ranch, Axelrod’s wife and (then) teenage children were subjected to nightmarish “dogmen” appearing in their backyard; to blue, red, yellow and white orbs routinely floating through the home and in the yard; to black shadow people standing over their beds when they awoke; and to a relentless barrage of loud, unexplained footsteps walking up and down the stairs in their house. What was once a normal middle-class home in suburban Virginia became an inferno of bizarre unexplained phenomena. And Axelrod and his family were certain that the trigger for this transformation was his first trip to Skinwalker Ranch. It is indeed lucky that the Axelrod family was, and is, extremely stable, psychologically well-adjusted and grounded and prone to matter-of-fact reactions to these events. 

In vivid contrast to the reaction of the Axelrod family is the reaction of Juliett Witt and her then roommate to the intense poltergeist activity that erupted in their home following her two-day visit to Skinwalker Ranch in August 2009 (see Chapter 6). The sudden eruption of poltergeist activity—during which two wine bottles were flung across the room, ceiling fans would turn on, TVs turn off on their own, lights going off or flickering, books showing up piled at the base of the stairs, clothing moved and laid out on the daughter’s bedroom floor with no one else in her house—has continued to this day. The paranormal intrusion into Witt’s house originally caused a severe emotional reaction in her roommate and provoked the young man to leave the house. This emotional outcome of a Skinwalker transmission event was a warning to other military personnel who were contemplating spending time on the ranch. 

Health Effects

The health effects of “bringing something home” were immediately apparent when Jim Costigan and his wife Laila experienced a very close encounter with a blue orb in their quiet Maryland neighborhood in September 2009 (Chapter 8). Her upper arm was briefly grazed by a low flying blue orb as it flew past her and disappeared into the neighborhood. Almost immediately Laila became ill and experienced a constellation of unusual symptoms before being eventually diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. 

The Axelrod family also suffered health effects with the wife suffering flare-ups of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus) and Raynaud’s Disease. Both Axelrod teenagers also suffered intense flu-like symptoms at different times following anomalies in their home, with the most serious medical symptoms occurring in the younger teenager after being attacked on the night of February 7, 2011, by blue and red orbs in his bedroom.

Without breaking medical confidentiality and HIPAA, it can be unequivocally stated that a large number of people who brought something home from Skinwalker Ranch also began to experience autoimmune disease in one or more family or household members. These autoimmune diseases included Graves’ disease (thyroid), Sjogren’s syndrome (salivary and tear glands), Hashimoto Thyroiditis (thyroid), rheumatoid arthritis (joints), and lupus (heart, lung, muscle). Because of medical confidentiality issues and the need to observe HIPAA requirements, and secondly, because the numbers are too low to evaluate cause-and-effect significance, there will be no more discussion of the autoimmune effects in these families. 

During the AAWSAP BAASS program, the phenomenon of ranch visitors bringing something home with them became the rule. Even ranch owner and BAASS founder Robert Bigelow reported numerous anomalies and unusual activity in his home in the months and years after visiting Skinwalker Ranch. In January 2021 in an interview on Mystery Wire, Bigelow opened up about this phenomenon to George Knapp: “Well, yeah, so hitchhikers being that you take, you take things home with you. Everybody took things home with them; I took things to my house, things happened to my wife and to me in different places. So everybody took things home. But we didn’t know that, gee, it was going to be kind of permanent. We didn’t know that it was going to stay with you for maybe years and years or rest of your life. Who knows?”

Before and after the AAWSAP BAASS investigations on Skinwalker Ranch, George Knapp made several visits to Skinwalker Ranch, some lasting overnight. Subsequent to the trips, Knapp reported that his wife experienced multiple apparitions in their home, including sightings of blue orbs outside the window of their place in Las Vegas. 

Kelleher and Knapp have separately interviewed more than 10 security officers who had spent two-week tours of duty on the ranch as a part of the AAWSAP BAASS program, and each security officer confirmed that they had brought “something” home from Skinwalker Ranch with them. The officers confirmed that they or their partners had experienced poltergeist and other paranormal activity in their homes following their tours on the ranch.

James Lacatski experienced a profound anomaly on the ranch in 2007, which was a significant instigation for the formation of the AAWSAP BAASS program. Lacatski and his wife experienced a few, but not many, anomalies in their home in the years following his Skinwalker Ranch sighting. But DIA official Susanna Ash, who was hired at DWO in January 2011 and sat in the office cubicle at DIA next to Lacatski between February and June 2011, reported that on the night of February 6, 2011, the night before Lacatski’s February 7 briefing to the DHS (see Chapter 16), Eddie Ash, Susanna’s brother who previously had no experience whatsoever with anomalies, had an escalating series of close encounters with UAPs in rural Mocksville, North Carolina, that continued for months afterwards. Eddie’s quiet country home suddenly had large orange UAPs hovering outside at night. Aerial photos of his house were sent to his mobile phone from unknown numbers. And his pet dog once disappeared (through multiple locked doors) while Eddie slept, only to be found in the morning whimpering outside. Could Lacatski have transmitted “something” to Susanna Ash who subsequently passed it to her brother? 

Axelrods and the Infectious Agent Model

To tease additional details out of the widespread pattern of “people bringing something home,” we need to revisit the Axelrod family. The Axelrod teenagers endured some very scary episodes in their bedrooms and were wise enough to keep quiet about them among their circle of friends. 

Imagine Paul Axelrod’s shock when he was approached by one of his high school friends in 2011 who told him that on the previous night, he had looked out his bedroom window and had witnessed a large wolf-like creature standing outside his bedroom looking in at him. A few weeks later another friend told Paul of seeing strange blue lights flying around his backyard. These revelations by the two friends came without prompting from Paul. In other words, they cannot be dismissed as “me too” phenomena.

The experiences by Paul’s school friends suggests that the perception of bizarre creatures and blue orbs was transferable beyond the Axelrod family home and out into the neighborhood. It’s unlikely that these events could be explained as a series of improbable coincidences. Instead these occurrences led Kelleher to consider an infectious disease model to try to shed some light on the phenomena, as they bore a striking resemblance to transmission of an infectious agent between individuals. The “symptoms” of the “infection” comprised the eruption of poltergeist and other paranormal events in the immediate environment of the newly infected individual. 

Infectious Agent Model

During 2020 and 2021 everyone in the world became excruciatingly familiar with the jargon of coronavirus infectious disease modelling. After thousands of newspaper, TV, and digital media reports detailing the first COVID-19 index cases in Washington state, Wuhan, California, and New York, the concept of an index case for an infectious disease is now familiar to everyone. Just as the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the wet markets in China may have been the source of the COVID-19 outbreak, could Skinwalker Ranch be the source of an infectious agent?

Utilizing this terminology, Axelrod was the index case who was first “infected” on Skinwalker Ranch and carried the infectious agent 2,000 miles home to Virginia with him. Within a few days or weeks, the agent had spread from Axelrod to his wife and both his teenage sons, and all three began experiencing a bewildering diversity of anomalies in their home. Within a few more weeks the infectious agent had spread to the neighborhood and infected two teenage friends, probably at school, who lived within a couple of miles of the Axelrod home. It should be noted that the symptoms of infection from Skinwalker Ranch are not respiratory distress or death, as with COVID-19, but rather profoundly altered perceptual environments. 

In standard infectious disease parlance, the basic reproduction number (denoted by R0) is a measure of how transmissible a disease is. It is the average number of people that a single infectious person will infect over the course of their infection. In the “Axelrod outbreak,” the basic reproduction number R0 could be denoted as 3. Therefore, any study of the putative transmission of the Skinwalker Ranch infectious entity would be very amenable to standard infectious disease modeling. The tools of infectious disease modelling are well established. 

It goes without saying that the numbers of people involved in these observations are too few to draw any firm conclusions, but the metaphor of an infectious disease could be a useful one for future research on the human effects of visiting the Skinwalker Ranch. 

As is now generally known, Robert Bigelow sold Skinwalker Ranch to Brandon Fugal in April 2016, and four years later the History Channel began airing TV documentary episodes entitled The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch. Many anecdotal reports have begun emerging regarding individuals on Skinwalker Ranch “bringing something home” with them in the past few years. The reports of this same infectious phenomenon have become so plentiful that it is now known as the “hitchhiker” effect. Not only do these more recent reports of hitchhikers constitute strong confirmation of the “infectious model” suggested here, but they add new impetus to begin an epidemiological modelling effort. 

Obviously, in order to drill down into this infectious disease possibility, a much larger epidemiological modeling effort would have to be initiated, one in which every individual and their family members who spent time on Skinwalker Ranch could be followed closely and interviewed every few months over a several year period. 

Social Contagion Model

An interesting paper published in 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association7 showed that gunshot violence follows an epidemic-like process of social contagion that is transmitted through networks of people by social interactions. The objective of the study was to evaluate the extent to which the people who will become subjects of gun violence in Chicago can be predicted by modeling gun violence as an epidemic that is transmitted between individuals through social interactions. According to the results, “social contagion” accounted for 63.1% of the 11,123 gunshot violence episodes in Chicago; subjects of gun violence were shot on average 125 days after contact with their “infector,” the person most responsible for exposing the subject to gunshot violence. Some subjects of gun violence were shot more than once.

The authors write: “Our findings suggest that the diffusion of violence follows an epidemic-like process of social contagion that is transmitted through networks by social interactions.” In other words, the transmission of violence, although not an infectious entity, follows a predictable social contagion model that is amenable to analysis and, subsequently, to intervention.

Researchers who balk at the notion of an infectious disease-like “transmission” of events following visits by individuals to Skinwalker Ranch might be more amenable to the examining the data via a social contagion model. But regardless of the epidemiological model utilized, the central point is that the AAWSAP BAASS program on Skinwalker Ranch was the first to unmask a transmission-like phenomenon that was occurring in individuals who visited the ranch, and that this transmission is profoundly amenable to analysis utilizing standard infectious disease or social contagion modelling. Further, in some cases, the transmission into some households was correlated with the emergence of autoimmune disease in family members.

Previous Evidence of Transmissibility?

In 1973, when noted illusionist and psychokinetic practitioner Uri Geller was undergoing a series of tests of his psychic abilities at the prestigious Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), a series of bizarre events began to unfold both in the lab itself and at the homes of the scientists who were conducting the studies. As with the Skinwalker Ranch, many of the researchers involved had high level security clearances.

Author Jim Schnabel, in his engaging history of American psychic spies,8 recounts the bizarre series of events that unfolded at the lab when scientists began to “measure” Uri Geller’s alleged psychic abilities. Writes Schnabel: “Peter Crane who was a team leader at LLNL, a PhD scientist with TS SCI clearances and some of the others in the Livermore group quickly found themselves involved in more strangeness than they could handle. In the days and weeks that followed, they began to feel that they were collectively possessed by some kind of tormenting, teasing, hallucination-inducing spirit. They all would be in a laboratory together, setting up some experiment, or one of the fellows and his wife and children would be at home, just sitting around, when suddenly there in the middle of the room would be a weird, hovering, almost comically stereotypical image of a flying saucer. On the other hand, the flying saucer wasn’t the only form the Livermore visions took. There were sometimes animals—­fantastic animals from the ecstatic lore of shamans—such as the large raven-like birds that were seen traipsing through the yards of several members of the group. One of them appeared briefly to a physicist named Mike Russo (who also possessed TS SCI clearances) and his terrified wife. The two were lying around one morning when suddenly there was this giant bird staring at them from the foot of their bed. After a few weeks of this, Russo and some of the others began seriously to wonder if they were losing their sanity.” Other scientists and their families saw orbs and black shadowy forms in their homes.

There are some interesting overlaps between the events at Lawrence Livermore in 1973 and those that occurred at the Axelrod’s residence and at the homes of other Skinwalker Ranch visitors some 37 years later. In both, the central “victims” were individuals with high level clearances and are/were working in senior position levels in several government agencies. In both, an initial “psychic” trigger (Uri Geller to Livermore and Axelrod’s or Costigan’s visit to the ranch) plunged multiple people, and their families, into a netherworld where high strangeness events unfolded. In both, balls of light presented unexpectedly to family members. In both, bizarre, archetypal, mythological animals and birds manifested. In both, multiple poltergeist-like phenomena affected families. In both, the experiences appeared to be centered near bedrooms, hallways, and backyards of homes involved. In both, black rectangles (Axelrod, Witt) or black cubes (Livermore scientists) were involved. Intriguingly, physicist Hal Puthoff was a central player in both the Lawrence Livermore and, as an AAWSAP BAASS consultant and contractor, in the Axelrod and other post Skinwalker Ranch incidents.

Chapter 10:   
Senator Harry Reid’s Letter 

By the end of May 2009, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was a worried man. A few days previously, he had received a thorough briefing on the progress of the new AAWSAP BAASS effort from aerospace billionaire Robert Bigelow and the breadth and the scope of the investigative horsepower of the fledgling organization had astonished the senior politician. Given what he had just heard from Bigelow, Reid was concerned that BAASS would get too high a profile at DoD in the near future and that the AAWSAP contract would be exposed and essentially unprotected from potential opponents at DoD. 

But there was another reason for worry. Over the years Reid had caught various straws in the wind that both Russia and China were involved with, and heavily invested in, UAP-based advanced technology research programs. That chatter had intensified, and by May 2009 Reid was concerned that the United States was asleep at the wheel, that the mixture of bureaucratic fear, careerism, and scientific conservativism at the Pentagon was handcuffing the ability of the United States to make progress in exploiting UAP-based technology. 

In Reid’s mind there was a grave danger that China and Russia, who were not similarly handcuffed, would succeed in taking quantum leaps forward from exploiting UAP-based hardware and thus gain an irreversible technological upper hand over the United States. On June 24, 2009, Reid took the bull by the horns and, in consultation with the intelligence community, drafted a bold letter to then Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn. 

A new unclassified nickname, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), was created for use within the unclassified letter because it was decided for security reasons not to use the AAWSAP acronym. Reid’s letter was carefully crafted to initiate the process of urgently conferring Special Access Program (SAP) status to some of the more sensitive projects at BAASS.

The third paragraph of the majority leader’s letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn was very specific: “In order to support this national effort, a small but highly specialized cadre of Department of Defense (DoD) and private sector individuals are necessary. These individuals must be specialized in the areas of advanced sciences, sensors, intelligence, counterintelligence, and advanced aerospace engineering. Given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving space flight, weapons, communications and propulsion, the standard management and safeguarding procedures for classified information are not sufficient. Even the use of conventional SAP protocols will not adequately ensure that all aspects of the project are properly secured.” 

Senator Reid closed his powerful letter with a statement that directly addressed his primary concern about the danger that Russia and China were gaining a technological advantage over the United States through their exploitation of UAP-related hardware: “Ultimately, the results of AATIP will not only benefit the US Government but I believe will directly benefit DoD in ways not yet imagined. The technological insight and capability gained will provide the US with a distinct advantage over any foreign threats and will allow the US to maintain its preeminence as a world leader.” In the letter, Reid nominated his long-time senior staffer Robert (Bob) Herbert to be the official point of contact with DoD. 

Reid instructed Herbert to deliver the highly confidential letter to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Lynn. Herbert brought the letter to Lynn’s office and, following protocol, delivered the letter to Marcel Lettre, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs at the Pentagon. Sometime later, it transpired that the letter had been photocopied by unknown parties and copies given to people at the Pentagon, at the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI), and at DIA. 

The widespread distribution of Senator Reid’s once secret letter caused controversy. Among the surprised recipients of the letter was then Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence General James R. Clapper and Susan Jones, who at that time was a senior official at the Special Programs Office at USDI. Within a few weeks of the letter being circulated, a meeting was convened at the Pentagon, and in attendance were Lynn, Jones, Lettre, Clapper, Bob Carlsberg, who at time was a senior DWO official at Defense Intelligence Agency, as well as others. 

The biographies of the attendees at this pivotal meeting read like a Who’s Who of subsequent career success at DoD. By 2011 Lynn would retire from DoD and assume a position as senior advisor at the Center for a New American Security, a prestigious bipartisan think tank. Jones would be promoted to a very senior advisory capacity at the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Lettre would quickly be promoted through the ranks and would serve two productive years (2015-2017) under President Obama as the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and following that he became a Senior Vice President for National Security at Lockheed Martin Corporation. Within less than a year after the meeting, General Clapper would be appointed as the fourth U.S. Director of National Intelligence from August 2010 to January 2017, and following his retirement, his frequent and highly publicized tussles with President Donald Trump would make him a household name. The most senior DIA person attending the meeting was Bob Carlsberg. Within a year of the meeting, Carlsberg retired from the Department of Defense after serving as the Senior Intelligence Officer and acting Division Chief Defense Warning Office. By 2021 Carlsberg was affiliated with The Admiralty Trilogy, a family of simulations that focuses on Tactical Naval Warfare. 

Kelleher was told that the meeting began with the Honorable William Lynn uttering “Is this about those damned flying saucers?” 

The unwanted publicity and scuttlebutt generated from the widespread routing of Senator Reid’s letter had everyone fired up. But in less than an hour the meeting had broken up with the decision to “postpone” any probability of the AAWSAP BAASS program proceeding to Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC) consideration within DoD. However, the pressing need for a Special Access Program (SAP) for contract data exploitation was still determined to be necessary.

But there was another consequence of the widespread distribution of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s confidential letter. The low profile of the AAWSAP BAASS effort at DWO was now a thing of the past, and by September 2009, at the beginning of the second year of the program, multiple levels at the OSD, the USDI, and at the DIA were aware of the “flying saucer” project at DIA.

Chapter 11: Meeting with the   
Air Force Office of   
Special Investigations 

Active measures are contradictory: they are covert operations designed to achieve overt influence, secret devices deployed in public debates, carefully hidden yet visible in plain sight.

There were piles of snow on the sides of MacDill Boulevard outside the main gate entrance to Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. December 11, 2009, was a chilly grey day, and Lacatski, Kelleher, and BAASS Director of Investigations Larry Grossmann alternately blew into their hands and stomped their feet as they emerged from the car parked near the building that housed the Air Force Office of Special Investigations-Special Projects, also known as AFOSI-PJ. 

Grossmann and Kelleher had flown from Las Vegas the previous night, and the intent was to meet with a senior team of officials from AFOSI-PJ. Grossmann, now a senior BAASS investigator, had previously spent decades as a field AFOSI counterintelligence operative. It was no mean feat for an up and coming, and practically unknown, organization such as BAASS to get a meeting at AFOSI-PJ. 

The AFOSI-PJ publicly stated mission explains: “The mission of the Office of Special Projects (PJ) is to deliver robust and flexible multidisciplined security and investigative services to special programs. PJ is responsible for performing program security, inspections, investigative and counterintelligence functions for all Air Force Special Access Programs.” The summary belies the legendary status this organization enjoys.

BAASS wanted to establish a relationship with AFOSI-PJ for several reasons. The primary reason was to explore the possibility that BAASS could share its UAP sighting data (with all witness personal details redacted) with AFOSI so that AFOSI could identify those sightings that involved Air Force Special Access Programs. Then, by elimination, BAASS could concentrate on the sightings that were “unknown.” By eliminating the cases that were “ours,” BAASS could thus prevent a waste of its time and resources on investigating secret Air Force technology. In turn, BAASS would function as an Operational Security (OPSEC) conduit for AFOSI-PJ, by alerting the Air Force whenever Advanced Technology Projects were seen by significant numbers of the public. In the counterintelligence parlance, BAASS could function as an OPSEC sensor for AFOSI-PJ. 

After negotiating the heavy layers of security at AFOSI, Lacatski, Kelleher, and Grossmann met with Jack Angelo, who in December 2009 was the Director of Operations, Office of Special Projects, and two other members of his team, AFOSI special agents who maintained a politely skeptical air throughout the briefing. Angelo was briefed on the BAASS organization and its more than 50 researchers, analysts, and investigators. When Angelo asked about BAASS security, Grossmann briefed him on the facility’s clearance, which was certified by the DSS; on the BAASS building communications, which were certified by the National Security Agency; and on the disposition of the security clearances for all 50 plus BAASS personnel. Grossmann described the constant presence of armed security guards at all BAASS facilities, including the constant presence of security officers at Skinwalker Ranch, which was formally a BAASS property for the duration of the AAWSAP contract.

Kelleher then gave a summary of the BAASS scientific division, which included deep expertise in Theoretical and Applied Physics; Electrical, Software and Mechanical Engineering; as well as PhD-level scientific expertise in the Life Sciences in both theoretical and experimental biochemistry, molecular & cell biology, genomics, immunology, and virology. 

Angelo was informed of BAASS’s multidisciplinary approach to not only aggressively seek out what space technology would look like 40 years in the future, but to also simultaneously identify any information that could constitute a threat to national security.

Kelleher and Lacatski explained the primary BAASS focus on investigating, researching, and cataloguing in multiple linked separate databases all nuggets of information focusing on the theoretical and applied physics of UAP activity and performance. They detailed the twelve primary areas of UAP research interest, which includes Lift, Propulsion, Control, Power Generation, Materials, and Configuration/Structure. 

It was obvious from the questions from the AFOSI-PJ Director of Operations and his colleagues that the link between BAASS programs and AFOSI-PJ remained elusive. Then 45 minutes into the briefing, Angelo bluntly asked what BAASS needed from AFOSI-PJ. Kelleher and Lacatski’s replies were equally blunt: BAASS needed data from AFOSI on historical and current UAP events, specifically for data that AFOSI had gathered on the October-November 1975 incursions by unknown flying objects into the so called “Northern Tier” Air Force bases at Wurtsmith AFB Michigan, Loring AFB Maine, Malmstrom AFB Montana, and Minot AFB North Dakota. It was well known and a matter of public record that AFOSI had responded vigorously and thoroughly with in-depth investigations into these incidents that had profound implications for national security. 

Angelo and his group listened politely and promised to see what they could do. However, as the meeting broke up, the central cautionary tale was that BAASS needed to be read into some Special Access Programs in order to progress much further in a relationship with AFOSI-PJ. 

This ground-breaking meeting was only the first of a series of initiatives that BAASS undertook in order to establish a working relationship with AFOSI. In late January 2010, Grossmann was on a plane from Las Vegas to Washington, D.C., for a clandestine meeting with Colonel Barry Hennessey. Now retired, Hennessey had previously been USAF Director of Security, Counterintelligence and Special Program Oversight at the Pentagon. Hennessey had also been one of Angelo’s predecessors as the Director of Special Projects at AFOSI-PJ, and his name was inextricably linked with many UAP cases during the 1980s and 1990s in which AFOSI was known to be involved.

Hennessey, who already knew that BAASS had briefed AFOSI-PJ just 30 days previously, was very intrigued by this new DIA interest in UAPs and commented that he was curious as to why the government saw fit to look into this controversial subject again. He explained that during the years and decades of research and development (R&D) of both F-117 and B-2 aircraft, AFOSI-PJ maintained a very active surveillance of UAP reports and UAP organizations producing those reports. The purpose was to “deconflict” with the Air Force R&D programs. Hennessey confided that a substantial number of “UAP sightings” during the 1970s-2000 were identified by AFOSI-PJ as known Air Force SAPs and R&D efforts. The counterintelligence czar also acknowledged that they could not identify a substantial number of UAP sightings that AFOSI-PJ investigated throughout the years. This included a few of the mysterious intrusions into the Northern Tier Air Force bases in the 1970s. 

Grossmann reminded Hennessey of the Loring AFB Maine encounters during which airmen patrolling the weapons storage area on October 27 and 28, 1975, reported low-flying aircraft circling the facility, then heading toward Grand Falls, New Brunswick, and disappearing from the Loring control tower radar screens. Grossmann commented that it was a matter of public record that AFOSI had sent a Technical Services Team into Loring Air Force Base in response, and that the AFOSI team had actually monitored and documented UAP activity as a part of their investigation. Were those investigative records accessible at the AFOSI records storage facility in Waldorf Maryland, inquired Grossmann? Hennessey smiled and replied that many old files had been purged over the years based purely on their age and that there had been no rhyme or reason to these almost random removals. Hennessey mentioned that the USAF Historical Research Group at Maxwell AFB Alabama may have been alone in being exempt from the wholesale deletion of AFOSI paper records.

Hennessey also told Grossmann about some of the advanced Air Force programs on micro-UAVs, and how these micro-UAVs could easily be mistaken for non-human technology. Without divulging any classified information, Hennessey appeared to be warning his interlocutor not to automatically assume that all very advanced looking technology was non-human. Hennessey was warning BAASS not to over-interpret the plethora of emergent data on “orbs.” 

The meetings with Jack Angelo and Barry Hennessey solidified within the upper BAASS echelons that it was vital to create a Special Access Program with two objectives: to protect the increasingly sensitive information that BAASS had begun to acquire, and to gain entry into the deeper recesses of AFOSI-PJ and other organizations.

Chapter 12: Hostile Triangles:   
Ours or Theirs?

In war-time, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.

—Winston Churchill, at a November 1943 meeting in Teheran with President Roosevelt and Josef Stalin10

  


At 11:45 p.m. on Friday May 8, 2009, a 49-year-old man named Derek Jones was alerted by his two dogs barking in his backyard in north Georgia, where his 10-year-old son was camping outside with a neighbor’s child in a tent. Jones quickly noticed a very large triangular aircraft, with lights at each apex, moving silently almost directly above him. The craft had a yellowish light at each of the three points, and a large bluish-white light in the middle. 

Behind the large triangle object were four smaller objects, each emitting their own sourced lights of various changing colors. Two were egg-shaped and two were round. The bluish white lights would change to a greenish color then back to white, then bluish again. These objects appeared to be much smaller than the triangle, but Jones acknowledged that it is difficult to estimate size and altitude at night. The smaller objects moved soundlessly, displaying erratic up and down patterns of darting movements away from the large triangle object and occasionally going down into the woods behind his backyard. (The yard has a grassy area 75 yards from the house leading to a wooded tree line.) The smaller objects repeatedly descended behind the tree line (out of the witness line of sight) for 2–3 seconds, then flew back up to the large triangle object in the sky. Jones insisted that the objects showed no means of propulsion. 

Jones estimated that the large triangular craft, which was 60 to a few hundred feet above him, was about 300 feet in length. It made no sound. He could see stars on the bottom of the object as if an attempt was made to camouflage the craft, but at the same time he could see the clear outline of the triangle due to the lights of his house and those in the neighborhood. Jones observed the objects making several maneuvers that he “knows are not possible in modern aviation capabilities.” When they darted below the tree line, he was not sure if they landed or not.

Jones attempted to record the object, first by videotaping it and subsequently by photographing it with a digital camera, but during both attempts the camera batteries died even though both instruments had been functioning earlier. 

When Jones decided to point his million-candle-power spotlight beam at the large triangle, he received an immediate response. From the front center section of the triangle came an intense bluish white light about two-to-three feet in diameter that struck him for about three seconds. The witness turned his back and ducked to shield himself from the bright light. The beam emitted an intense heat that caused a burning sensation on Jones’ neck and shoulders. He quickly dashed back into his house. 

Jones continued to watch the spectacular panorama from the safety of his own home. The smaller objects started to move slowly in a south by southwest direction. Abruptly two of the smaller objects then left the triangle at an incredible speed, moving directly upwards and quickly going out of his sight. 

Jones then watched the larger triangular object rotate up on its end and pivot so that he could see the base of the triangle edge on, facing straight up and down in his line of sight. From this vantage point, the triangle now looked like a black rod with the two smaller objects beside it. Jones estimated that the objects were about 200 yards away before they suddenly shot straight up directly away and out of sight. In subsequent interviews Jones mentioned that the objects entered a “swirly thing”; his drawing of it looked like a large vortex. Before he went to bed Jones logged onto his computer and filed an online UFO sighting report with MUFON (Mutual UFO Network). MUFON in turn notified BAASS since the two organizations were engaged in a collaborative relationship.

Jones reported feeling an intense headache, weak, and extremely nauseous. He remained immobile on his couch for the entire day. He also reported a metallic or “coppery” taste in his mouth. When he woke up the following morning, his mouth, neck, and upper shoulders felt sore and burnt. He tried to vomit several times throughout the day but failed.

Jones awoke about 2:00 a.m. the next day, disturbed by several low flying helicopters around his house, one of which appeared to be maneuvering very low and close to his home. Some helicopters in the distance were using white searchlights in the standard law enforcement protocol of searching for something or someone. Jones woke up his wife who confirmed the helicopters. 

Just over five hours later, at 7:30 a.m., a series of loud knocks at the door woke him up. His wife had gone to work that morning at 5:00, and his son was in bed asleep. The two men on Jones’ doorstep brusquely told him they wanted to talk to him about his “sighting report.” The men were driving a late model four-door Ford sedan with white plates. Jones felt intimidated by the two men and warily invited them to come in and sit in the living room.

The older of the two men, who identified himself as “Mr. Michael,” initiated all of the questioning. Mr. Michael, who was in his 40s, wore a black suit, white shirt, black tie, and very polished shoes. He had a very pale complexion with dark gray hair. The younger man, who had dark hair and appeared to be in his late 30s, was similarly dressed. Both men stood over six feet tall and looked to weigh more than 200 pounds. Jones told BAASS investigators that neither man spoke like people native to Georgia. 

When they sat down on the couch, Jones noticed what he thought was a handgun under Mr. Michael’s suit coat. The conversation quickly turned into an interrogation; Mr. Michael did most of the talking, the younger man sat forward on the couch staring at him in a hostile manner. At no time during the interrogation did either of the two men produce any identification.

The interrogation focused on what Jones had seen on Friday night, May 8. The two men took copious notes and appeared to be drawing diagrams, as Jones responded to their detailed questions. After 30–40 minutes, the two men abruptly stood up to leave. The younger man told the now thoroughly frightened Jones not to mention the sighting to anyone else. 

About a week after the incident, Jones drove into town and pulled into a gas station when the same black sedan carrying the two mysterious men who had interviewed him pulled in behind him. Jones clearly recognized the younger man at the wheel of the vehicle. Jones called BAASS and reported that he thought the sedan was following him. This time Jones had the presence of mind to make note of their plate number. After a lot of legwork by BAASS investigators and one of their contract researchers, the license plate of the Ford sedan was unambiguously tracked to a specific Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carpool. 

Health Effects 

BAASS physicians and researchers rigorously followed all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) privacy protocols in their medical interactions with Jones. BAASS investigators noted and photographed hair loss on the back of Jones’s head within 18 days of the incident. Still feeling unwell, Jones went to a local medical facility three weeks after the event and had blood drawn. 

The blood test results showed some abnormalities. Four parameters of a simple hematology screen had values that were not normal. The fifth value, red blood cell count = 4.6, lay precisely on the lower end of normal. BAASS kept in regular contact with Jones in the weeks and months following the incident, including face-to-face interviews. Throughout this period, he complained of feeling weak and generally unwell. 

Beginning in early October 2009, Jones began reporting that lumps began to appear on his legs, groin, and back. In late February, during a visit to his endocrinologist for his diabetes, he asked his physician to examine his lumps. But she refused, citing her lack of expertise in diagnosing lumps, but confirmed that Jones had multiple lumps in his body. BAASS investigators subsequently took multiple photographs of those lumps.

By the end of February 2010, Jones was reporting that all the lumps had grown considerably in size and some of them were becoming increasingly painful. A medical appointment to determine the nature of the lumps was scheduled for March 12, 2010. Two physicians performed a multi-hour medical exam of Jones and provided the following information on his medical condition: 

“An ultrasound scan of Jones’s abdominal area revealed a right lower quadrant mass, ill defined, possible hepatitis, hepatic mass R/O primary malignancy secondary to ionizing radiation injury. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Hematological findings consistent with non-hemolytic anemia. Elevated A1C (glycosylated hemoglobin = 8.9), consistent with Jones’s diabetic condition. Multiple large reactive nodules were exceptionally painful to the touch.” 

Following the medical examination, it became apparent that about 20 more lumps had appeared all over his body at the rate of 2-3 monthly since February 2010. The lumps appeared primarily in the groin, right lower quadrant of abdomen and back, underarm, back of knees, and sides of neck.

About a year after his encounter, Jones had one of the 24 nodules on his body surgically removed for pathology examination. A BAASS contract physician was in attendance. After conferring with the local hospital physicians, a preliminary diagnosis of non-malignant lymphoma was introduced, although the surgeon told the BAASS contract physician that in his 22 years as a board-certified pathologist, he had never seen a case like this. Since Jones now had 24 separate lumps, the physicians were concerned about his prognosis. It was fortunate that the pathologist who was the primary point of contact for the BAASS contracted physician was also a board-certified cytogeneticist, which specializes in the detection and interpretation of chromosome abnormalities. 

Although the initial diagnosis was of a benign disease, the pathologist was concerned because Jones might have had aggressive multicentric Castleman’s disease, which can easily progress into malignant lymphoma and can be fatal if untreated. A second ultrasound scan of Jones’s abdomen was conducted to re-examine the mass that was found on his liver six weeks previously and to determine if there were additional, previously undetected lumps in his abdomen. And additional blood tests confirmed the red cell anemia that had been found on the first set of tests.

In early June 2010, the BAASS contracted physician told Kelleher that his working hypothesis was that Jones’ lymphoma was consistent with the biological effects of being irradiated by about 300 Gy. Due to HIPAA concerns BAASS has concealed the identity of Jones as well as the identity of the BAASS contract physician. Also in line with HIPAA privacy protocols, we will not go into further details of Jones’ medical condition except to focus on the hypothesis that he suffered from medical sequelae as a result of being irradiated by possible non-ionizing radiation on the night of May 8, 2009. 

The Jones case raised many questions:

  * Who owned the low flying triangle and the four accompanying objects that were hovering and flying over the Jones property on May 8, 2009?
  * Why was Jones irradiated? Was he simply “in the wrong place at the wrong time”?
  * Was the report filed by Jones to the MUFON database in May 2009 intercepted by the Department of Homeland Security? If so, was this interception carried out utilizing FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) protocols and regulations?
  * Were the two DHS operatives who harassed Jones on Sunday May 10, 2009, and subsequently, attempting to obtain information on the accidental leak of a United States Government Special Access Program involving a 300-foot silently flying triangle that had blatantly broken security procedures and had irradiated an innocent citizen of the United States who was standing on his own property and who was not breaking any laws?
  * Alternatively, were the two DHS agents investigating this event in the same spirit as BAASS personnel who were investigating the event? Were the two DHS agents attempting to find as much information as possible on the five technologically advanced unidentified flying objects that had been detected over Georgia as a UAP event? After all, Jones’ description of a “swirly thing” in the sky just prior to departure with the craft and two small objects entering it may suggest an unusual UAP event rather than an advanced United States aircraft.



The perennial question of is it “ours or theirs” that BAASS faced was familiar to Kelleher, who had been haunted by the identical question while he was the project manager at National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) from 1996 to 2004. During that period, NIDS spent an inordinate amount of time investigating hundreds of cases of what came to be known as the Low Flying Large Triangle or “Black Triangle” phenomenon and eventually selected just 127 of those cases for closer study. 

The high-profile triangle case that had initially galvanized NIDS involved the sighting by four policemen and several other eyewitnesses in Illinois on January 5, 2000. The case gained considerable media notoriety and was the subject of an hour-long TV documentary entitled UFOs over Illinois on the Discovery Channel. It is worth briefly revisiting the case because it exemplifies the characteristics of the Low Flying Large Triangle phenomenon that NIDS subsequently investigated; it also bore some of the characteristics displayed in the Jones case of 2009.

The 24-hour NIDS hotline had received a report at 3:46 a.m. Pacific time on January 5, 2000, from Craig Stevens, a police officer in Millstadt, Illinois. He reported that an unidentified flying object had been seen by a business owner and several police officers at Lebanon, Millstadt, Shiloh, and Dupo, Illinois. The report to NIDS came approximately two hours after the sighting. After multiple telephone calls to Illinois, NIDS dispatched two seasoned investigators—a retired FBI agent and a retired AFOSI investigator—to conduct face-to-face interviews with eyewitnesses. The following is a summary of the interview transcripts.

The civilian, Malvern Noll, who had driven to his miniature golf course in Highland, Illinois, at 4:01 a.m. that day reported seeing an object like “a floating house” with very bright internal lights flying at a low altitude from northeast and moving southwest. The object was two to three stories high and was the length of a football field. He immediately drove to the Highland Police Department and reported the sighting. The dispatcher from Highland contacted the Lebanon Police Department to look out for the object.

At about 4:10 a.m., Ed Barton, a police officer from Lebanon, responded to the dispatch from Highland, and reported seeing a low flying, “massive, elongated triangle” that emitted rays of intense white light all around. The object came to within a thousand feet of Barton where it appeared to rotate slowly. Barton said it did not bank like a normal airplane but rotated while it hovered. The object then suddenly flew extremely quickly, several miles in a few seconds, across the sky toward Shiloh. The maneuver was executed without noise as officer Barton had turned off his engine, his emergency light rotator, and the main police radio so that he could listen for noise. The police dispatch then radioed ahead to Shiloh to watch for the craft. 

Shiloh Police Officer David Martin then reported seeing a craft shaped like a large black triangle with bright white lights on it that first hovered then flew about 4 to 5 miles across the sky at very high speed. Watching from his vehicle with the windows rolled down and the engine shut off, Martin said this maneuver was executed with almost no noise. Since there was no wind at the time, this maneuver was judged to be inconsistent with that of a blimp. The dispatch then radioed ahead to Millstadt.

At 4:30 a.m., Millstadt Police Officer Stevens described seeing the object flying very slowly between 500- and 1000-feet altitude. It was very large and shaped like a fat arrowhead. The rear of the object was concave and looked to contain dim, white, flashing strobes. Officer Stevens lost the object as it flew in a northwesterly direction towards Dupo.

According to the testimony from the police officers, the flight path of the object was in a southwesterly direction from Highland, over Lebanon, Shiloh, Millstadt, and then turning northwest to Dupo. The flight path would have taken the object almost directly over Scott Air Force Base, which is located in Shiloh. According to interviews conducted by the NIDS investigator of two Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) officers, nothing was in the air from Scott Air Force Base that night between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. 

A report published on the NIDS website in 2001 summarized the characteristics of 127 separate reports of large black triangular objects detected over the United States, the majority between 1999–2001. The recurring characteristics of the objects described in this report were: (1) Flying at low or very low altitude (50-500 feet) sometimes over highly populated areas; (2) Huge or large; (3) Flying silently; (4) Hovering or flying very slowly (less than 100 mph); (5) Very brightly lit, sometimes with multi-colored lights. Back in 2001, the craft performance characteristics in these 127 reports was not consistent with any acknowledged aircraft being deployed by the United States military. 

The Georgia triangle witnessed by Jones had exhibited all these characteristics and neatly conformed to the majority of entries in the NIDS Low Flying Triangle database with one glaring difference: the radiation of the witness causing a plethora of subsequent medical injuries.

Chapter 13: AAWSAP Progress

By the end of the nineteenth century, the conceptual framework formulated by physics to describe the inanimate world seemed to be infallible in its predictions. However, there were some anomalies that appeared unimportant. It took a quarter century to explain these “little” anomalies, but doing so required the overturning of almost all the fundamental assumptions of classical physics. This process gave birth to quantum mechanics and general relativity.

The 24 months between September 2008 and September 2010 were enormously productive for the AAWSAP BAASS effort. The center of daily operations was far away from the bureaucratic machinations occurring in Washington, D.C. In Las Vegas, Nevada, the 50 strong team of BAASS analysts, investigators, scientists, and engineers were working full time on expanding the BAASS spheres of accomplishment. Details of the organizational structure under which AAWSAP BAASS operated are described in Appendix II. This chapter describes the different kinds of programs conducted from BAASS headquarters in Las Vegas that took place for AAWSAP between 2008 and 2010.

Monthly Reports

Activity reports, sometimes hundreds of pages in length, were sent to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) every 30 days. These reports summarized dozens of separate “boots on the ground” UAP investigations and progress on expanding investigative activities on and around Skinwalker Ranch. The subject of each monthly report is explained in Appendix I.

BAASS-MUFON Collaboration

In order for AAWSAP BAASS to best serve the government, it needed to become the central information source on UAPs in the United States. It was essential to receive information on UAP activities that were occurring in real time until such time that BAASS had sufficient staff to acquire data on its own. 

One way AAWSAP BAASS achieved that goal was to contract with an organization that had hundreds of investigators already in place around the United States. The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) was such an organization. MUFON had been in existence for four decades and at the time had approximately 1000 trained volunteers who could investigate reports of UAP sightings in all 50 states. 

With the assistance of John F. Schuessler, a founder and board member of MUFON, in February 2009, BAASS executed a purchase order contract with MUFON that entitled BAASS to receive notification of significant reports on UAP sightings from anywhere in the United States within hours, receive timely reports from specially-trained MUFON investigators regarding investigations of these incidents, and receive physical evidence (including photographs, digital recordings, samples of soil, insects, plants, and animals) for scientific analysis. BAASS had multiple laboratories that were ready to conduct forensic, photographic, metallurgic, chemical, isotope, biological, and chemical analysis of any specimens that BAASS received from MUFON. 

BAASS had already hired a small team of 10 investigators with extensive intelligence and law enforcement investigative experience. These investigators were located in Las Vegas and trained to deploy as “rapid reaction” investigative teams anywhere in the United States if BAASS determined that high value UAP cases submitted by MUFON warranted additional investigations. 

MUFON initiated their field deployments in support of AAWSAP BAASS by April 2009. As a result of substantial funding from AAWSAP BAASS to MUFON, MUFON’s Case Management System (CMS) database was upgraded to support project operations and a considerable effort was made at the MUFON archives to catalog archive holdings. 

Many of the BAASS monthly reports that are described in detail in Appendix I indicate some of the dozens of cases from MUFON that were investigated by the rapid reaction teams.

The Original 2009 Tic Tac Investigation

AAWSAP was first to hear about and investigate the Tic Tac case back in January-June 2009 (Chapter 5). After Doug Kurth had apprised Kelleher of the Tic Tac case and Kelleher had informed Lacatski, the investigative wheels of AAWSAP moved into high gear.

Between January and June 2009, Axelrod and his team of investigators first tracked down and interviewed the four pilots, each of whom had independent visual sightings of the Tic Tac. 

As is now known, between November 10-16, 2004, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group (CSG) was operating off the western coast of the United States in preparation for their deployment to the Arabian Sea. The CSG comprised the USS Nimitz, USS Princeton, USS Chafee, USS Higgins, and the submarine USS Louisville. Notably, the USS Princeton was the first Ticonderoga class cruiser to carry the upgraded state-of-the-art AN/SPY-1B radar system, which was used to track the Tic Tac activity between November 10-16, 2004.

The four witnesses were Commander David Fravor USN and Lieutenant John Agnelli USN (not his real name, but the fourth Tic Tac pilot’s name has never been made public and since he is active-duty military, per DOPSR input, the authors have decided to give him a pseudonym) who were flying F/A-18F Super Hornets with call sign FastEagle 01, and Lieutenant Alex Dietrich USN and Lieutenant Commander James Slaight USN who were flying FastEagle 02. These four eyewitnesses formed a rock-solid set of corroborated testimonies.

According to Fravor, the first indication he had of the unknown contact was a visual of a disturbance in the water below the Anomalous Aerial Vehicle (AAV, another term for UAP). As Fravor scanned the water, he gained a visual on the object.

Fravor then initiated the brave and bold move to detach FastEagle 01 from its altitude at 20,000 ft while Dietrich and Slaight in FastEagle 02 remained at 20,000 ft. Fravor told Axelrod that he descended to about 12,000-16,000 ft to get a better view of the AAV. As Fravor descended, Agnelli was in constant communication with both the Princeton and with FastEagle 02.

Fravor told Axelrod that, as he descended, the object was “holding like a Harrier,” which means it was hovering in one place over the water like the Harrier AV-8B Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft. According to Fravor, the object was like an elongated egg or a Tic Tac and had a discernable midline horizontal axis. Agnelli described it to Axelrod as “solid white, smooth, with no edges. It was uniformly colored with no nacelles, pylons or wings.”

Fravor then descended to about 10,000 ft with the intention of getting closer, and as the pilot maneuvered, in Fravor’s words, the Tic Tac appeared “to recognize us.” The commander said the object then “pointed” or realigned its axis in the direction of their aircraft and “started to mirror us.” Fravor then pulled a maneuver to try to get even closer, and suddenly the Tic Tac began to accelerate aft of them at supersonic speed.

The radar operators from the Princeton broke in with astonishment saying: ”you are not going to believe this, it’s at your CAP,” meaning that in a couple of seconds the Tic Tac had flown to their training Combat Air Patrol (CAP) located about 60 nautical miles away in the southern end of the training area, and amazingly the AAV had also climbed to 24,000 ft. 

The shocked reaction from the Princeton was because the CAP point was a secret location with precise latitude, longitude, and altitude. According to Princeton radar operators, the Tic Tac was not near the CAP, but right on the precise latitude, longitude, and altitude. Only a few on the Princeton and the pilots knew about it, but here was the Tic Tac showing up there seconds after leaving Fravor and FastEagle 01 in the dust.

Axelrod reported that the pilots and the Princeton radar operators were puzzled about how the Tic Tac could have known about the precise three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude) of the CAP.

Following the incident with the AAV and after he had landed FastEagle 01 back on the Nimitz, Favor reported to the Carrier Intelligence Center (CVIC) and detailed the entire encounter to the Carrier Air Wing Intelligence Officer, who in turn reported it to the Commander of the Air Wing. The Carrier Air Wing Intelligence Officer completed a mission report (MISREP) and emailed the MISREP to the U.S. 3rd Fleet Intelligence where it was received and acknowledged. According to Axelrod, “because the CSG was on a training mission,” the MISREP was not forwarded up the chain of command.

By June 2009, Axelrod had completed his report, which contained the following three blockbuster assessments: “The Anomalous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) was no known aircraft or air vehicle currently in the inventory of the United States or any foreign nation. The AAV exhibited advanced low observable characteristics at multiple radar bands rendering US radar-based engagement capabilities ineffective. The AAV exhibited advanced propulsion capability by demonstrating the ability to remain stationary with little or no variation in altitude transitioning to horizontal and/or vertical velocities far greater than any known aerial vehicle with little or no visible signature.”

In an ironic presaging of the June 25, 2021, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) Report, Axelrod’s team had concluded twelve years prior to the UAPTF Report that the Tic Tac was not owned by the United States or by China or Russia.

Since the Tic Tac investigation was initiated and executed by AAWSAP BAASS, Axelrod’s 13-page report was one of the 100 reports AAWSAP submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Once The New York Times had broken the story in December 2017 and apart from extensive media coverage of the event, the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) also conducted an in-depth forensic investigation of the incident and in April 2019 released a 270-page report that included an analysis of the speed and acceleration of the Tic Tac.12 The SCU report corroborated the main elements of Axelrod’s June 2009 report, which had been written and submitted fully ten years before the SCU report.

BAASS UAP Database

Meanwhile the disciplined team comprising almost a dozen analysts and translators was busy culling thousands of separate UAP reports from France and other European countries, from Brazil and other South American countries, and from Russia, creating a very large data warehouse based on UAP performance. 

Each of the tens of thousands of cases entered into the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse was initially painstakingly analyzed by the AAWSAP BAASS team utilizing the Vallee Source Visit Probability (SVP) protocols and the Vallee Index of Credibility Methodology. These terms are more fully defined and referenced in Chapter 19 in the section on the Data Warehouse.

By the end of the first year of operations (2009), the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse consisted of nine databases and their associated supporting documentation, such as witness interviews, photographs, videos, recordings, sketches, laboratory and analytical reports, etc. Eight of the databases contained historical reporting information. By the beginning of the second year of operations, the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse contained tens of thousands of sighting and investigative reports on UAP events, including the National Institute for Discovery Science database, a Pilot Database amassed from hundreds of separate military and civilian pilots, the USAF Project Sign/Grudge/Blue Book Database, the Project Colares Database, the Canadian Release Database, the United Kingdom Release Database, and other databases.

AAWSAP Investigation of Soviet Thread III UAP Program

In June 2010 AAWSAP delivered a 149-page report to DIA entitled:” Russian Thread III Project.” This report was a summary of several months of analysis by AAWSAP BAASS of more than a hundred pages of documents in Russian obtained by George Knapp while on investigative trips to Russia in 1993 and 1996. 

Thread III was the official name for a wide-ranging technical analysis of Abnormal Aerospace Phenomena (AAP), what we now refer to as UAPs, that was conducted by more than 15 separate military units, scientific institutes, and Departments in the Ministry of Defense in what was then the Soviet Union. When Knapp went to Russia in 1993 and 1996, he was introduced to several prominent scientists, ufologists, and high-ranking military members, including a Russian Air Force Colonel who was a member of the Soviet Thread III team. Prior to the AAWSAP report delivered to DIA, the documents that Knapp obtained had never been fully translated into English. 

The Thread III documents contain a very detailed organizational chart of the different institutions that were a part of the Soviet UAP investigative effort. The documents show that beginning in 1991, the Soviets launched a comprehensive and sophisticated program to address the UAP in their country and that this undertaking dwarfed any acknowledged program in the United States or in any other country.

AAWSAP BAASS employed a group of three Russian translators to rapidly decipher the contents of the documents. Analysts quickly noticed that in the Thread III organizational chart was a shadowy group named Soviet Military Unit 73790, one of no less than three separate UAP collection efforts. This unit was thought to be the driving force behind the Soviet Thread III program. 

The listed objectives of the Thread III program included: “Develop methods to formalize initial data on AAPs for computer processing; Create a digital database for AAP study and effects; Study possible correlation between helio-geophysical factors and AAP origin and development (i.e. study atmospheric and seismic correlations); and Study the impact of AAP beam plasma on radio/technical equipment.” 

In short, the objectives of the 1991 Soviet Thread III Program show interesting overlaps, including identical objectives, to the June 25, 2021 UAPTF Report that galvanized the world in the summer of 2021. The main difference, of course is that Thread III happened fully 30 years before the UAPTF Report. 

The Thread III documents provided no conclusions regarding what the Soviets obtained on UAPs, but the 149-page report that the DIA has in custody provides a graphic warning that the Soviet Union/Russia was potentially ahead of the United States in its knowledge of UAPs, as far back as 30 years ago. The AAWSAP report on Thread III underscores the strong concern that Senator Harry Reid had about other countries gaining a technological advantage in UAP research over the United States when he first moved to create the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program. For example, after reading through the AAWSAP Thread III report, an analyst could legitimately wonder whether Russian Military Unit 73790 had made any progress on analyzing, or utilizing, the UAP technology in the past 30 years.

AAWSAP Investigations in Brazil

In parallel, two separate BAASS teams of investigators and Portuguese translators were dispatched to Brazil; one team was based in northern Brazil near Fortaleza and the other team met with Brazilian government officials in Brasilia and in Sau Paulo regarding the official Brazilian release of UAP documents. The north team from BAASS was deployed to the State of Ceará to meet with several Brazilian UFO organizations and leaders, as well as to follow up on recent UFO sightings that had been reported by several news media outlets. They planned to travel to four locations, including Fortaleza, Sobral, Corrego do Salgado, and Cachoeira, which is in the Itatira Region. 

Meanwhile the southern BAASS team met with multiple Brazilian UAP organizations around Brasilia and Sau Paulo. They also met with General Paulo Roberto Yog de Miranda Uchôa, who was retired from the Brazilian Army and was the current National Secretary of Politics on Drugs. This was a follow-on meeting to one that occurred previously between General Uchôa and BAASS executives in Washington, D.C. (Chapter 6). General Uchôa was working to obtain personal interviews with, and medical records of, a woman who was allegedly cured of Chagas disease after a UFO encounter.

General Uchôa also discussed Operation Plate (Colares) in detail. 

During the 1970s, with the highest activity reported during late 1977, the Brazilian island of Colares and the surrounding area of the Amazon delta were visited by flying objects of an unknown nature. Several different types of unidentified airborne phenomena were reported—some big, some small, saucer-shaped, cigar-shaped, barrel-shaped, luminous or not. Some objects were observed originating from underwater or flying into water. A number of Colares area inhabitants reported being targeted by strange lights beamed from the objects, with many describing similar ill effects with a few reported deaths. The Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB, First Regional Air Command) conducted an on-site investigation from 1977 to 1978 that was titled “OPERAÇÃO PRATO” or Operation Plate. The investigation reportedly generated over 1,000 pages of documents, logs, sketches, and maps; over 500 photographs; and fifteen hours of motion film. Over the years, hundreds of pages documenting the Brazilian Air Force’s investigation have been leaked or have been officially distributed. As a part of the database project, AAWSAP maintained copies of the original Brazilian Portuguese materials and versions translated into English by in-house Portuguese translators.

In 1983, General UchÔa worked with a Brazilian Air Force Colonel, now retired, who commanded the intelligence unit that investigated the events at Colares. The meeting between the AAWSAP team with General Paulo UchÔa proved invaluable in orchestrating subsequent releases of official Brazilian Government UAP documents.

Advanced Physics Analysis of Tic Tac

In an additional 141-page report delivered to DIA in December 2010, AAWSAP included a detailed advanced physics analysis of the Tic Tac velocity and acceleration that was distinct from Axelrod’s report discussed previously and submitted separately to DIA. 

A major part of the analysis of Tic Tac speed and acceleration performance utilized ANSYS Engineering Software. Back in 2010, the ANSYS Workbench platform was a powerful multi-domain simulation environment that harnessed the core physics from ANSYS, enabled their interoperability, and provided common tools for interfacing with CAD (computer-aided design), repairing geometry, creating meshes, and post-processing results.

To BAASS’s knowledge, this powerful computational capability had not been previously utilized in the 75-year history of UFO study. The 141-page report that was submitted to DIA stated: “It is hypothesized that through this broader ranging ANSYS analysis, additional theoretical constructs can be generated regarding UAP and USO behavior. These in turn could provide the scaffolding for advanced engineering concepts.”

The report included ANSYS simulations and analysis of Tic Tac velocities and acceleration as well as simulations of a Tic Tac entering the water and simulations of Tic Tac movement through water. These latter simulations could form a baseline for future UAPTF studies and analysis of so called “transmedium” UAP behavior, as reported by documentary filmmaker Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp. A “transmedium vehicle” is usually defined in this context as one capable of operating in multiple domains, for example in the air and underwater.

This 141-page UAP Analysis report, which has been archived at DIA since December 2010, could provide current investigators with useful baseline parameters from which to catalog future UAP behaviors.

BAASS Program on Utilizing Scientific Remote Viewing

It was very fortunate that BAASS counted among its ranks of senior advisors none other than Hal Puthoff, the father of the CIA’s Remote Viewing Program and arguably the world’s authority on the development of Remote Viewing methodology. Puthoff’s enormous experience in the STAR GATE and other remote viewing programs, together with an international cadre of collaborators, meant that BAASS could “jump start” a remote viewing program with only minimal set up time. 

From time to time during the STAR GATE program, remote viewers had detected exotic events and technologies relevant to the AAWSAP BAASS initiative. These included detection of apparent basing facilities for exotic craft, description of apparent exotic craft accidents, and observation of exotic craft surveillance of military targets, the latter correlating with independent national resource records. 

Protocols for the use of remote viewing as an information-gathering tool responsive to AAWSAP BAASS objectives could have included the assignment of Remote Viewing (RV) tasking to previously calibrated RV team leaders/teams; the use of blind targeting (i.e., RVer kept blind to specific target) so as to minimize “analytical overlay” (imagination artifacts) due to expectations or pre-biases, i.e., no “front-loading”; the generation of complete RV session records in the form of tape recordings, drawings, etc., to be made available for later independent analysis; the integration of data from multiple RV sources; the independent evaluation of data stream by analyst(s); and follow-up efforts to provide for independent verification and validation on the basis of “ground truth” reality whenever feasible. As indicated in Chapter 3, the AAWSAP contract did not include a remote viewing development program, primarily due to the cost. However, approval was granted to BAASS to conduct a limited feasibility test.

In March 2010, Joseph McMoneagle, one of the premier remote viewers in the U.S., was asked to observe a target designated as “22610” using traditional blind targeting protocols. “22610” was actually Skinwalker Ranch. Blind targeting protocols mean he had no knowledge that the ranch was his target. As expected, McMoneagle’s sketch of the Skinwalker Ranch, description of the environment, animals present, and characteristics of the two ranch managers and two security guards were excellent. But he indicated that a fifth individual was also present. McMoneagle described a male, 60–70 pounds, with a height of 4'3" with no hair. Age was not able to be determined. Exact physical features were unclear, as opposed to those of the managers and guards. McMoneagle said that the fifth individual could not be seen by ranch personnel but did attempt test communications with them to see their response. He indicated that the communication was not precise or clear, and to the individuals on the ranch it would seem to come from above and behind their heads.

Project Physics

By far the most highly publicized project that had been ascribed to AATIP, the nickname of AAWSAP in the media, was what BAASS internally called Project Physics, which was subcontracted to EarthTech International in Austin, Texas. The purpose of Project Physics, as described previously, was to invite the best scientific and technical experts to write “state of the art” white papers that would project aerospace capabilities 40 years out into the future. The feedback from multiple individuals, departments, agencies, and groups within DoD was unanimous: the 38 papers represented an enormously positive addition to the intellectual property at DoD on future aerospace technology. Even the most senior DoD officials were effusive in their praise, including Frank Kendall, who was then Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. He praised the quality of the DIA reports.

Design and Construction of a Prototype for an Autonomous UAP Surveillance Platform

For those knowledgeable about the UAP topic, it is no secret that one of the high priorities in the field was the construction of autonomous UAP detection platforms designed to collect data on UAPs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without having human observers present. The best-known example of this approach was Project Hessdalen in Norway, which was led by engineer Erling Strand and colleagues and which evolved into an international collaboration and successfully collected UAP data for decades.13

Hidden within the voluminous AAWSAP BAASS reports delivered to DIA (see Appendix I) was a small gem that detailed the design, component selection, manufacture, and assembly of a prototype for a fully autonomous UAP surveillance platform that could be trucked to a location and left to gather data. 

A team of BAASS mechanical, electrical, and software engineers was tasked with coming up with the design, prototype build, and assembly of the unit within the extraordinarily truncated timeframe of twelve months.

The report delivered to DIA details the component down-selection, model number, and cost of all of the off-the-shelf components designed into the unit, including an outdoor rugged electromagnetic (EM) spectrum analyzer, an EM power meter, an omni-directional microphone, an Inertial Measurement Unit for gravitational and magnetic field sensing, an embedded ruggedized computer, an ultrasonic microphone, a weather station, an outdoor Internet Protocol (IP) infrared camera, and an Industrial Crate Wagon for portability. 

In addition, the SolidWorks (engineering computer-aided-design software) mechanical design and placement/assembly and packaging of the components is detailed in the report, as is the Software Architecture block diagram for the Surveillance Unit. In the short period of AAWSAP’s existence, a functional prototype of the platform was built, and testing had begun when the program was terminated in late 2010.

Investigation of Historical UAP Incursions into   
Northern Tier Air Force Nuclear Bases

AAWSAP delivered multiple reports to DIA, including monthly reports, which detailed different levels of investigations into several historical incursions of UAPs into the Northern Tier nuclear missile bases during the 1970s. To fully appreciate the magnitude and scope of the incursions by UAPs into restricted airspace surrounding the nuclear weapons missile sites around the United States over a period of decades, the reader is advised to read UFOs and Nukes by Robert Hastings.14 Hastings’ book also unveils the staggering failures by United States intelligence agencies over decades in ignoring the glaring evidence of these UAP incursions into the most sensitive weapons storage areas in the nation.

During the parallel investigations into some of these Air Force base incursions conducted by AAWSAP, BAASS attempted to identify, track down, and interview specific eyewitnesses to these events.

In one example, Stephen A. Smith told BAASS investigators that he was an Air Force sergeant stationed at Wurtsmith Air Force Base (WAFB) in 1975. He was assigned as a boom operator aboard a KC 135. He stated that in October 1975 their flight was returning to WAFB when they were vectored to check on an unidentified aircraft that had been hovering over the Weapons Storage Area. To have an unidentified aircraft anywhere close to the Weapons Storage Area on one of the premier nuclear missile bases in the United States has grave national security implications. 

At that time, Smith was in the cockpit of the KC 135. They located the unidentified aircraft and followed it over the course of approximately 1-2 hrs. They never got close enough to see the craft’s shape; he only saw a single, steady orange light. Smith said it is difficult to tell how close they got to the craft, as he saw nothing that would allow him to judge distance. Smith reported to AAWSAP investigators that the craft was flying between 350- 400 knots. According to Smith, the craft was “playing” with them, “as when the KC 135 would turn away, the craft would continue on, but eventually would come back into the direction of the KC 135.”

AAWSAP investigators also identified and contacted retired Air Force eyewitnesses who were stationed at Malmstrom, Loring, Minot, and other Air Force bases and within less than a year had assembled a comprehensive database of contact details for dozens of separate witnesses who had reported seeing intrusions of unidentified objects into restricted airspace. This summary was submitted to DIA as a part of the monthly reports. 

AAWSAP investigators also investigated more contemporary cases of unidentified traffic in the vicinity of United States Air Force bases. In March 2010 Staff Sergeant Omar Gonzalez from Dakota Air Traffic Control (DATC) located at Ellsworth Air Force Base (EAFB) in South Dakota contacted BAASS to report that on March 3, 2010, he and his crew were working the Traffic Control section during the swing shift when their radar picked up unidentified traffic crossing a passing aircraft, call sign Columbia. The Columbia pilot responded saying that he had visual contact with the object. Gonzalez then selected the target and discovered it had “no beacon and no altitude,” while the Columbia pilot said the object was passing approximately 2000 feet above him. This encounter occurred about 18 miles south of the EAFB runway. Suddenly the object vanished from view, and simultaneously Gonzalez reported the radar track disappeared. 

A few minutes later the target suddenly reappeared on radar, this time behind the Columbia aircraft. AAWSAP followed up and interviewed the primary witnesses but had difficulty obtaining the cockpit transcripts from EAFB. Eventually after multiple rounds, BAASS was successful in obtaining the cockpit transcripts through the Freedom-of-Information (FOIA). As of late 2010, when the AAWSAP program prematurely shut down, the EAFB object remained unidentified.

Report of Investigation of UAP Encounter with  
F-15Cs near RAF Lakenheath UK

This incident happened in 2007 and, in hindsight, was probably similar to many of the alleged 144 encounters with unknown objects that are detailed in the June 25, 2021 UAPTF Report. On the afternoon of January 12, 2007, amateur radio enthusiasts in England made a recording of an airborne US Air Force F-15C aircraft stationed at Royal Air Force Base Lakenheath, United Kingdom. The recording captures two USAF F-15Cs that had numerous radar tracks and a few visual sightings of an unidentified object. 

According to the report submitted by AAWSAP to the DIA in May 2009, investigators conducted a preliminary telephone call with the former Commanding Officer of the 493rd Fighter Squadron, followed by a face-to-face interview with the lead pilot involved in this event, which confirmed that the recording is authentic and the event did take place. 

The two F-15Cs were on a routine training mission in the East Anglian Military Temporary Reserved Airspace (MTRA) over land and just North of RAF Lakenheath on January 12, 2007. Both aircraft were equipped with APG-63v1 Suite 4 modern mechanically scanned pulse-doppler radar. Once the flight arrived in airspace, the captain separated the two aircraft with him going west and his wingman going east. The captain gained a radar lock of unreported traffic approximately 15 nautical miles in front of him. He executed a bump acquisition (break lock and attempt re-lock) to validate the target. The radar reacquired the track indicating something at 17,700 ft mean sea level (MSL) at low speed. He maneuvered his F-15C to attempt to visually identify the track. Flying an intercept profile, he visually acquired the object at about 500 ft distance. He stated it was small, black, with one main body and no visible attachments. The shape was not uniform and the Captain likened it to a “meteor rock”—it was not reflective.

The captain was joined by his wingman, and together they made at least three additional passes while the object was tracked on radar by both aircraft multiple times using “auto guns” mode to achieve the lock. On each visible pass, the pilots in both aircraft confirmed that it looked like a black rock, but it was not falling. The object did not appear to react to their presence. 

The object remained unidentified, but as with the more modern sightings mentioned in the UAPTF report, years after the incident the pilots speculated that the rock-like object might have been a weather balloon, although they admitted that during the incident, they did not think it was a weather balloon. As was usual in 2007, and perhaps today, the squadron or pilots did not officially report the incident to any US or DoD agencies, except their air traffic controller.

The 2007 Lakenheath incident bears many of the hallmarks of the more recent events documented in the June 2021 UAPTF report.

Chapter 14: AAWSAP Visits Skinwalker Ranch and Surrounds 

I am not a believer. I am an ‘experiencer.’ I know for a fact that it is real and have witnessed with my own eyes, with other credible witnesses at my side, what can only be described as daylight sightings of exotic craft over Skinwalker Ranch. 

—Brandon Fugal, current owner of Skinwalker Ranch6

Screening of Skinwalker Ranch

In the summer of 2009, two BAASS senior investigators arrived in Roosevelt, Utah. Both individuals had decades of experience in counterintelligence. It was their mission to conduct a comprehensive criminal and counterintelligence assessment of the area around the ranch and to perform a technological sweep of the ranch managers’ home and Command and Control Center for radiofrequency readings that might be indicative of an outside surveillance effort.

At the Best Western Inn, they obtained a baseline reading of radio frequency (RF) signals in the Roosevelt area using an OSCOR 5000E Enhanced Omni-Spectral Correlator. The next morning, they obtained a second set of RF traces at the hotel for contrast with the prior evening signals. They then traveled to the Skinwalker Ranch, contacted the security guard force, and took several RF readings over the next 24 hours. No RF signals of questionable origin were noted.

During the late morning and early afternoon, they used an ORION, Non-Linear Junction Detector on the interior of the double-wide command and control center, but no clandestine electronic items were found.

Their counterintelligence surveillance analysis of Skinwalker Ranch as well as the surrounding towns Fort Duchesne, Roosevelt, and Vernal, also focused on the relative ease of penetration of the property and evasion by trespassers of the round-the-clock security officers. The conclusion was that Skinwalker Ranch could be easily penetrated by persons with only a modicum of training who could remain undetected by the security officers on the property. This report resulted in a reworking of the security details that were posted to Skinwalker Ranch in order to deter trespassers.

Interviews and Investigations 

Beginning in the summer of 2009, a BAASS team comprising six investigators, three scientists, and two technicians alternated one-to-two-week missions to interview area residents as well as to deploy sensor instrumentation at Skinwalker Ranch.

By March 2010 approximately 30 residents who had reported firsthand encounters were interviewed in their homes. The group comprised lifelong residents of the area, all living within a one-to-two-mile radius of Skinwalker Ranch. They included four local police officers, eleven Ute tribespeople, including a Shaman, twelve ranchers, six business owners, and the director of the local fish and wildlife office. Half were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Eleven of the individuals recounted firsthand encounters with a dog- or wolf-like creature that could run at speed on two legs, sometimes in conjunction with “orb like activity.” Its estimated height was six-to-seven feet. Many of these reported observations took place during daytime hours. Some sightings were very recent, only a month or two old, while others had taken place a few years ago. All observations had occurred within a five-mile radius of Skinwalker Ranch.

From the details provided in interviews about bipedal creatures, BAASS constructed a map showing the “migration routes” of these creatures. Whether these extraordinarily frequent bipedal dog-like creatures overlap with local “Skinwalker” lore is not known. Frequent sightings of small blue, white, yellow, and red orbs that were usually flying low to the ground was a persistent feature of these reports. The interview transcripts were carefully examined by independent analysts to identify confabulation from both witnesses and investigators, and only cases that were interviewed by multiple investigators and cross-referenced multiple witnesses were reported out to DIA. Because of these safeguards, later claims by a couple of retired ranch security guards that they had confabulated reports in order to earn the approval of superiors could be rebutted and dismissed.

Some neighbors had also witnessed unidentified flying aircraft, including triangular, cigar, and disc-shaped objects, the majority of which were silent “balls of light.”

BAASS investigators photographed some anomalous tracks, including two sets of barefoot human tracks merging into one, and a second set of barefoot tracks in the snow that approached a five-foot-tall, barbed wire fence and continued in the snow after the fence with no evidence of a broken stride and no evidence of either climbing the barbed wire fence or jumping over the wire. BAASS also obtained a variety of hair samples in the vicinity of these tracks. These hair samples were subjected to DNA analysis with inconclusive results.

Skinwalker Ranch Research 

For the duration of the AAWSAP contract, BAASS compiled a large database of more than 200 separate reports of anomalies that were documented by the teams of BAASS security officers who were on the property 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The reported events were analyzed and categorized and included:

• Sensed or perceived presence

• Perceptions of being watched

• Observations of paranormal events

• Perceptions of emotional distress

• Observations of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena

In addition, they obtained numerous photographs of orb-like lights, as well as other luminous phenomena, all of which were transmitted to the DIA along with the database of reports. 

Environmental Monitoring 

The AAWSAP contract enabled BAASS to execute a complete “soup to nuts” environmental survey of Skinwalker Ranch at a level of resolution that was not achieved during the NIDS program. The establishment of a grid system, in which the ranch was broken up into tenth-of-a-mile sections, enhanced the ability of the organization to obtain sequential data on electric and magnetic field activity, multi-element soil analysis, and contamination by ionizing radiation that could be directly compared over time. Appendix III lists the monitoring instrumentation utilized.

Plant and Seed Experiments 

The scientific investigation of the Skinwalker Ranch property included the use of plants, including transgenic (genetically engineered) plants, as biosensors of multiple radiation and magnetic field deviations from the norm. In 2010, a dozen biosensor plants were transported to Skinwalker Ranch; six Spiderwort plants and six Tobacco Plants. See Appendix III for technical details of the plant experiments. 

A seed germination and growth experiment were set up at both BAASS Headquarters in Las Vegas and on Skinwalker Ranch in 2010. BAASS Chief Biologist Roger Whittiker set up the BAASS control experiment, while BAASS Biologist Amanda Kruse set up the experiment in the Bigelow Ranch Trailer, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. See Appendix III for technical details of the seed experiments. 

Communication Experiments

The intent behind communication experiments was to test the hypothesis that some agency that appeared to exhibit intelligence was responsible for the 20-year history of anomalies on Skinwalker Ranch. Secondly, during the term of the NIDS presence on Skinwalker Ranch (1996–2002), some early success had been achieved with the use of games and puzzles. The NIDS team had found on a couple of occasions that games patterns that had been left in a controlled environment with no humans present would be interfered with and new patterns created that involved moving game components in an apparently non-random manner. Such activity was observed in a small number of cases when interference by humans, animals, seismic effects, or weather had been ruled out. 

The majority of the communication strategies on Skinwalker Ranch used by BAASS were traditional and involved the initiation of a variety of games, puzzles, and other approaches in order to establish communication. A pre-locked game or puzzle would be set up in a location that would not be disturbed by human or animal. No access to the game was possible without keys that were housed in Las Vegas. The initial configuration of the game would be photographed, then re-photographed again 24 hours later. If any component of the game had moved during the previous 24 hours, the movement would be detectable by comparing the “before” and “after” photographs. The strategy and data from these communication games were described in the 360-page report entitled “Utah Ranch Investigation: August 2009–February 2010” delivered to DIA in April 2010.

Chapter 15: AAWSAP Findings from Skinwalker Ranch

Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly . . . with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science. It then continues with a more or less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. 

—Thomas Kuhn15

  


Several inter-related aspects to the reported events at Skinwalker Ranch have emerged from a close scrutiny of the data by AAWSAP BAASS scientists. Research on Skinwalker Ranch unmasked a previously hidden risk of working on the property. For example, five out of five intelligence professionals, the majority of whom had combat and military experience, had visceral anomalous experiences while visiting the ranch, became infected by a “contagion,” and brought the infectious entity back to their families and households on the East Coast. 

Therefore, among certain people, the phenomenon can “invade” households, family groups, and communities and, acting like an infectious entity, can cause these small groups harm (health and well-being). Skinwalker Ranch participants have transmitted the contagion to family members, many of whom in turn have been diagnosed with autoimmune disease, including Sjogren’s syndrome, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Myasthenia Gravis, Graves’ disease, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus), rheumatoid diseases, fibromyalgia and more. This finding can be considered one of the signature advances from the AAWSAP program. 

The authors emphasize that while on the Skinwalker Ranch property, Axelrod and colleagues witnessed a shiny silvery unidentified flying object that appeared to be of “nuts and bolts” construction, when they were patrolling the 500-acre property, while at the same time and in the same location the trio were exposed to non-physical phenomena that are familiar to parapsychologists (Chapter 1). This is an important point because it directly validates the AAWSAP strategy of researching both physical and paranormal facets of the UAP. 

Independent of Skinwalker Ranch, the AAWSAP reports delivered to DIA described a number of individuals who came in close contact with UAPs, and shortly thereafter suffered from a range of immune system related symptoms, including changes in immune cell number and immune function as measured by alterations in circulating blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, sudden autoimmune antigen expression, and increased circulating liver enzyme levels. 

The research conducted by the AAWSAP BAASS scientific teams on the biological consequences of visiting Skinwalker Ranch, and more generally on UAP close encounter cases, led to the conclusion that a large untapped reservoir of information lay inside the human body, if it could just be “decoded.” For example, in 2008-2010 the AAWSAP scientists and medical consultants pioneered the strategy of treating the immune system as a trillion-cell information processing organ, with ten times the number of cells as the brain, that is capable of recording (and subsequently reporting) insults from UAP experiences. This immune system data would be “objective” as opposed to the usual vagaries encountered while interviewing UAP eyewitnesses, including altered witness perceptions, false or implanted memories, and the general fog inherent in the UAP “Oz Factor.” The Oz Factor is the term that British UFO researcher Jenny Randles coined to describe the state of consciousness involving altered perception of time and space, sometimes (but not always) experienced during close encounters with UAPs and other anomalous experiences.16 

A distinct advantage in focusing on the immune system as an information processing organ was that interrogating the immune system is as easy and non-invasive as obtaining a blood sample. 

Electromagnetic Anomalies 

One set of measurements taken at a location on Skinwalker Ridge, during the comprehensive electromagnetic signature sweeps of the Skinwalker Ranch property (Chapter 14), indicated a strong, yet to be explained, signal that was not detected on multiple previous readings. The first signal was 1210, 1213 and 1216 MHz and the second large spike was 1232.5, 1235.5 and 1238.5 MHz. These signals fell in the frequency bands of 1164-1215 and 1215-1240 MHz, which are allocated for Earth exploration-satellite (active), radio location G56, radio navigation-satellite (space-to-Earth) (space to space) G132, and space research (active). These frequency spans are primarily for military purposes but can be used by other federal agencies in support of science and research. 

Since the electromagnetic signals detected on Skinwalker Ranch were sporadic and not repeated, no definitive interpretation can be made. Therefore, these data were classified as anecdotal by BAASS engineers and scientists. 

Gamma Radiation

Anecdotal evidence presented on the TV show The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, indicated that the scientific and engineering team on Skinwalker Ranch had made the shocking discovery in 2020 of detecting gamma radiation on the ranch property. The team utilized appropriate detection methodology and announced this discovery on the TV show. 

The alleged detection of significant gamma radiation on Skinwalker Ranch was both surprising and disturbing. Gamma radiation is a penetrating form of electromagnetic emission with high energy originating from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. It comprises very short wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy. When it impacts biological tissue, gamma radiation can potentially cause damage to cells, DNA, and cell membranes. 

This discovery of gamma radiation on Skinwalker Ranch was a potentially alarming development because gamma radiation is so potentially hazardous to humans. Leaving aside the obvious question of the source of gamma radiation on Skinwalker Ranch, the reported detection itself rattled a few cages among those who had previously been associated with AAWSAP research on Skinwalker Ranch.

![](../Images/image00155.jpeg)

This announcement caused the AAWSAP data on ionizing radiation that was collected on Skinwalker Ranch to be re-scrutinized. Numerous gamma ray measurements were re-examined that were made with a Canberra Colibri Geiger Counter during the AAWSAP BAASS tours of duty in 2009 and early 2010.

As described in Appendix III, representative gamma radiation samplings taken from multiple locations on Skinwalker Ranch had indicated only background levels of radiation present. In contrast to the findings from The Secrets of Skinwalker Ranch TV Series, the AAWSAP found no evidence of gamma radiation in any location on Skinwalker Ranch. 

Plant and Seed Effects on Skinwalker Ranch

A 360-page report that included comprehensive descriptions of the plant and seed data obtained by the AAWSAP BAASS team on Skinwalker Ranch was delivered to the DIA in April 2010. The purpose of the plant research on Skinwalker Ranch was to obtain pilot experimental data on whether plants could function as biosensors or reporters for any putative electromagnetic energy or other radiation on the property. 

The strategy was analogous to the use of canaries in the coalmines as biosensors for excess carbon monoxide at their work sites by British coalminers. The design and execution of these experiments is described in Chapter 14 and in Appendix III.

There were several tantalizing data obtained from the seed germination studies conducted on Skinwalker Ranch. The dry (dormant) seeds stored at Skinwalker ranch exhibited very different germination rates than those stored under similar conditions in Las Vegas. All germination rates were higher in dormant seeds stored on Skinwalker Ranch compared with controls that were stored in Las Vegas. In contrast, seeds that were received from the commercial distributor and immediately transported to two separate locations on Skinwalker Ranch and utilizing identical grow lights, environmental conditioning, and germination methodology (peat discs) showed dramatically slower germination rates in both locations on Skinwalker Ranch compared to the Las Vegas controls. It should be emphasized that every attempt was made to match the environmental conditions and to minimize variability between Las Vegas and Skinwalker Ranch in conducting plant experiments.

Though this data appear to be conflicting, the effects of electromagnetic (EM) radiation on dormant seeds are very different from EM effects on actively germinating plants. For example, Maffei17 reported that magnetic fields applied to dormant seeds increased the rate of subsequent seedling growth of barley, corn (Zea mays), beans, wheat, certain tree fruits, and other tree species. The stimulation of growth shown on dormant seeds stored on Skinwalker Ranch is in line with a large literature showing the stimulatory effects of EM exposure on dormant seeds.

In contrast, Vian and colleagues18 reported that high frequency EM radiation inhibits plant germination rates and overall decreased plant health depending on frequency and intensity. Thus, the data found in the pilot experiments on Skinwalker property were not contradictory, and the scientific staff of AAWSAP BAASS considered these initial pilot experiments worthy of repetition. 

The authors of this book recognize that the study of EM effects on seeds and on plants is a very complex research topic. Nevertheless, these preliminary experiments, which showed dramatic differences in germination rates between two separate locations on Skinwalker Ranch and the control locations in Las Vegas, are sufficiently intriguing to be worthy of repetition.

These experiments were terminated when the AAWSAP contract ended.

The Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) ran for just over two years, including a three month no-cost-extension that concluded on December 21, 2010. Even as the program was shut down at DIA, AAWSAP principals began looking for alternative locations at which to house what had become both a highly successful program but also a political hot potato. Several attempts were made by members of AAWSAP in 2011 to secure a place at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after the shutdown of the effort at DIA. They are described in this and the next chapter. 

On February 7, 2011, Lacatski walked up to the nondescript entrance of the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in downtown Washington, D.C. The erstwhile ballistic missile physicist and DIA analyst was on a highly secretive mission. He had scheduled a one hour briefing with two of the top officials employed at DHS, the keepers of the secrets at Homeland Security. Normally, joe citizens would never get to meet these two influential government officials, and Lacatski and others had worked some magic behind the scenes to make this meeting happen.

Lacatski sat down at the conference table in the SCIF with the DHS’s Jim Bell and Sacha Mover and began the briefing with the history of AAWSAP and BAASS, including the role of Robert Bigelow and Senators Reid, Inouye, and Stevens. As Lacatski began describing in detailed technical terms the multiple UAP investigations conducted by BAASS under the AAWSAP rubric, the level of astonishment in the two DHS officials began to rise. 

Then, about an hour into the briefing, technically when the meeting should have ended, Lacatski abandoned all caution and the flood gates opened. What followed was arguably one of the most astounding and riveting briefings of “nuts and bolts” UAPs, paranormal phenomena, poltergeist activity, and more ever heard in a United States Government SCIF. The bizarre creatures that were encountered on and around Skinwalker Ranch were described in excruciating detail, and Lacatski recounted cases involving multiple encounters with blue orbs as well as other details of UAP investigations that were extracted from the detailed monthly reports that BAASS had submitted to DIA for the two-year duration of the AAWSAP. 

Three and half hours later and late into the evening of February 7, the meeting broke up, and the two shell-shocked officials passed through the security gates and headed home for what was later described by both as sleepless nights. Lacatski said the “data dump” he had given the two DHS specialists was probably the most intense, harrowing explication of paranormal weirdness ever encountered by that level of government official. 

Then within a few hours, two sets of bizarre occurrences erupted that were directly connected to the information presented at the briefing, but not to the geographic location. 

In the Axelrod family’s quiet house in Virginia about 60 miles from the DHS building, the two teenage boys had gone to bed. But Paul, the younger boy, slept very badly that night; in fact, when his mother, Ruth, went into Paul’s room on the morning of February 8, she had great difficulty waking him up. She became worried and noticed that her son appeared to be extremely angry. He refused to wake up fully, saying repeatedly, “they kept me up all night.” 

When he was finally awake, Ruth saw with alarm that Paul’s eyes were red and very puffy, his face appeared swollen with several angry red welts on his cheeks. Even more disturbing, his mother saw multiple bright red contusions on his stomach and chest as if somebody had repeatedly and forcibly hit the boy. By this time, the entire family were in Paul’s room concerned that something serious was amiss. 

Paul was interviewed several times over on the phone during the following two weeks; he also had a face-to-face meeting with the BAASS contracted physician, Dr. Black. Paul had gone to sleep quickly after going to bed but had been awakened by a bright light in his room. The first visitors were a pair of blue orbs that cast a bright light through the room as they flew near the bedroom ceiling. Paul watched with apprehension as they flew near him, sometimes skimming him lightly. Paul’s next memory was awakening to two small red orbs flying near the ceiling in addition to the blue orbs, and they too appeared to “dive” at him repeatedly, causing the terrified teenager to hide under the bed covers. This cycle unfolded several times with the boy dozing fitfully. As the night wore on, Paul began feeling pain on different parts of his skin as the orbs brushed past him. When asked why he did not yell for help, Paul replied that he had tried, but he did not seem to be able to yell. Later that morning, the family linked the angry red welts on the boys’ torso, neck, face, and arms to the close proximity of the orbs. 

Paul also complained that two or three black shadow humanoid figures were in his room throughout the night, and that they were “screaming” as if they were being tortured and in a lot of pain. Paul, who is partially deaf, said the screaming from the figures took place telepathically in his head. He never saw the faces of the shadowy figures. The combination of the attacks from the blue and red orbs and the screaming black shadowy humanoids in his bedroom left the teenager exhausted, traumatized, and sick by the morning.

His mother reported to Kelleher in a telephone interview that Paul was very nauseous and running a high fever that morning. She kept him out of school that day and made arrangements with the local Urgent Care to bring her son in. 

On that same night, February 7, at almost precisely the same time, a bizarre theater played itself out in Homestead 2 on Skinwalker Ranch. Throughout the previous night and day, the dogs on the ranch had been acting very frightened, staying inside their outdoor kennels, which was usually an indication that something was amiss. That night the lieutenant of the guard, Philip Idiohorst, called Kelleher to report a foreboding atmosphere at the ranch, as if something was about to happen. The second guard on duty confirmed that something “weird” was afoot. Kelleher instructed both guards to keep a low profile, and when on patrol to have canines with them at all times. 

The guards left the command and control double-wide trailer for their nightly patrol shortly after 10 pm. It was a cloudy night with snow underfoot, and at 8 degrees, a biting freezing cold. Idiohorst instructed his guard companion to head for the east gate to look for any vehicle activity or evidence of trespassers, but both security officers knew that with those kinds of temperatures, trespassers were unlikely.

As Idiohorst approached Homestead 2, he snapped on his flashlight to negotiate the treacherous entrance. His dog companion began nosing around the outside walls of the structure, and the lieutenant knew from past experience that his dogs rarely ventured inside these old buildings. Idiohorst shuffled into the gloomy interior and placed his flashlight carefully on a small shelf in the corner of the room and turned it off. As he looked out the south window, the hairs on the back of his neck had begun to rise. The small room suddenly filled with a distinct “presence.” Idiohorst could feel his heartbeat increase, and the cold clammy atmosphere seemed to thicken. He was no longer alone. Idiohorst’s mouth ran dry as he looked carefully around the room. He could see nothing except blackness, but he knew that something else was in the room with him. 

Taking a deep breath, Idiohorst mentally commanded “show yourself.” Within less than ten seconds, the flashlight on the shelf 15 feet behind him abruptly blinked on then off. Temporarily blinded and now with heart pounding, Idiohorst fought to keep calm. His body coursed with adrenaline. Taking another deep breath, Idiohorst again requested “show yourself.” Instantly the flashlight blinked on, then off, and repeated the sequence two more times. The intensity of the moment almost overwhelmed him. He stood in the darkness trying to regain his equilibrium. He tried to figure out a location for what was in the room beside him but could only feel the “presence” all around him. 

Abruptly, Idiohorst grabbed the flashlight, turned it on, and scrambled out of the old building, half running, and half stumbling. He knew that his patrol was over for the night. With the Motorola two-way radio on his belt, he called the security officer down at the east gate who reported that all was quiet. 

By the time Idiohorst entered the warm, brightly lit headquarters, he had fully regained control of the fight or flight instinct, and his adrenaline had slowed. He had a severe headache and felt exhausted. After cursorily listening to his companion’s short and eventless debrief, Idiohorst headed for his bedroom in the command and control trailer. 

He slept fitfully through the night and awoke several times with a start. He had a series of nightmares of being back at Homestead 2 and at the mercy of some predator; when he awoke the morning of February 8, he felt like he had been beaten up. Speaking with Idiohorst over the phone, sometime later, Kelleher said that the stress and anxiety was unmistakable in Idiohorst’s voice and tone. 

Kelleher realized that what had happened on the night of February 7 constituted a very unusual occurrence on Skinwalker ranch. Actual communication had taken place between Idiohorst and “something” in Homestead 2, as opposed to the endless assortment of “random coincidences” that traditionally plagued the security officers. This marked the clearest conversation between a security officer, scientist, or investigator and the presence on the ranch for at least five years.

Kelleher wondered if it was complete coincidence that the two unrelated incidents, in Virginia and in Utah, had occurred almost immediately following Lacatski’s meeting with DHS in Washington, D.C. Had the meeting created a “disturbance in the force”?

The other hypothesis, of course, was that the incidents were entirely unrelated.

Chapter 17: The Department of Homeland Security

A scientist is supposed to have a complete and thorough knowledge, at first hand, of some subjects and, therefore, is usually expected not to write on any topic of which he is not a master. This is regarded as a matter of noblesse oblige. For the present purpose I beg to renounce the noblesse, if any, and to be freed of the ensuing obligation.

Kelleher, Puthoff, Lacatski, and Black had just entered the cavernous lobby of the Department of Homeland Security in downtown Washington, D.C., when Kelleher spotted Jim Bell in the hallway beyond the security control. As Lacatski and the BAASS trio approached the security check point, Bell spotted them and walked quickly over to speed up their sign-in process. Bigelow, Lacatski, and Kelleher had met Bell a couple of months earlier at the Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, when during dessert he had confided some war stories about his tours in Mogadishu, Somalia. With his jet-black hair and sallow skin, Bell displayed an aggressively cool demeanor. But today Kelleher could see the beads of sweat on Bell’s forehead.

Dressed in his crisp black suit, Bell led them through the torturous corridors of the DHS and into the SCIF. They were there to meet with Dr. Tara O’Toole, the Under Secretary for Science and Technology at DHS. For many years, O’Toole had been the Director of the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Kelleher and Black were also familiar with her academic publications in the biodefense field, including the response to biological attacks involving anthrax, smallpox, and plague.

Bell had set up the meeting to brief Secretary O’Toole on the top level BAASS program mission goals. Lacatski, Kelleher, Puthoff, and Black were there to answer any technical questions before exploring any areas of commonality that might lead to a BAASS-like program under the auspices of the Science and Technology umbrella at DHS. Specifically, the briefing would focus on the commonality of sensor technology applied to both a BAASS-like program and a collaborative Science & Technology program under the roof of the DHS. A secondary goal of the meeting was to explore how the advanced technology that lay at the heart of the BAASS program could be developed within DHS, thus potentially making this briefing a “win-win.”

When Tara O’Toole and her entourage swept into the room, pleasantries and small talk were in short supply. Turning to Jim Bell, she asked, “Why are we here?” When Bell began the briefing with a jargon-laden summary of the proposed program, O’Toole quickly interrupted him and asked why the three BAASS scientists were there. 

At that point, Kelleher, Puthoff, Lacatski, and Black took over the briefing. It was obvious the Secretary wanted technical details. The three experts immediately touted the BAASS achievements (2008-2010) that focused on the production of 38 advanced technology papers, followed by the scientific- and technology-driven investigations of the USS Nimitz Tic Tac episode. The Under Secretary punctuated the briefing with quick, decisive questions. Then Kelleher quickly briefed her on the sensor driven strategies utilized on Skinwalker Ranch. Black and Kelleher then focused the rest of the discussion with Dr. O’Toole on some of the medical investigations that BAASS had initiated. 

O’Toole listened with great interest as Black and Kelleher recounted the 2005 case of the Ron Becker encounter with blue orbs that had culminated in a host of biological and medical issues. O’Toole became more and more intrigued as time went on. At the end of the meeting, which had extended beyond the scheduled 30 minutes to beyond an hour, O’Toole exited the SCIF with the promise to continue the discussions on bringing a BAASS-like program under the roof of DHS. 

Following the meeting with the Undersecretary, the prospect of a program within DHS seemed promising. At that point the team was introduced to a very high-level official at DHS named Sacha Mover who was a driver of much of the relatively new DHS program initiatives (Lacatski had already met Mover). Mover had a fascinating story to tell the group. He had been born and raised in a rural area of Kentucky, and he told Kelleher that many of these small rural communities in Kentucky are still not on the electrical grid, partly because of a lack of political will and partly because the economics of electrification simply do not add up in the minds of many commercial power utilities that serve these small communities. 

In 2008, Mover went back to where he grew up in a Kentucky “holler” to meet with his family members and to renew some old acquaintances that he had not enjoyed for many years. His family members told him that about a year previously one night during an outdoor gathering, a low flying, large, brightly lit UFO had suddenly appeared over a nearby hill. Everyone watched in disbelief as the object moved slowly over the nearby hills. The object was huge, multi-colored, and silent. It remained in the vicinity for several minutes before shooting off at an impossible velocity. No one had ever seen anything like this before, and the incident was discussed endlessly for the rest of the evening. By the end of the night a lot of the neighbors had also heard about the amazing spectacle in the sky, and the inhabitants went to bed very late, still buzzing about the remarkable incident. 

Mover then told Kelleher that about 24 hours later three large black SUVs pulled up in the holler. Out of the black SUVs stepped several black-suited individuals wearing dark glasses. They loudly and urgently called for all the locals to gather together. Within about 30 minutes, all of the local holler inhabitants had gathered around the black SUVs, and the leader of the “Men-In-Black” began asking the locals about what they had seen in the sky. Slowly, after a lot of hesitation, some of the crowd gave a brief description of the spectacular UFO that they had seen the previous night. 

The leader then climbed on top of his vehicle and in front of the assembled holler inhabitants told them: “You would be well advised not to talk about this incident in the future.” Silence reigned over the crowd. Then loudly, he added: “It will be in your interests not to speak about of this incident again.” According to Movers’ family members who were present at the meeting, his tone was threatening. The message was unmistakable. An intimidating silence seemed to hover over the assembled crowd. 

Just as suddenly as they had arrived, the three black SUVs departed the holler at high speed. Then, oddly, within three months and without warning, a series of electrical transformers were erected in the Kentucky holler, and shortly thereafter, for the first time in their history, the holler residents were fully electrified. The technology was state of the art, and the puzzled holler inhabitants slowly began to suspect that there might be a link between the man’s threat, the fact that the holler denizens kept silent about the UFO incident, and the unexpected appearance of the high-tech electrification unit in their small community. 

Mover told Kelleher that this incident was worth looking into. He found the incident sufficiently intriguing that it had provoked a more open-minded attitude toward strange things, and he was therefore willing to go the extra mile in accommodating the often-outlandish requests from BAASS.

Shortly after the successful meeting with O’Toole at DHS, Sacha Mover and Jim Bell began knocking on doors beyond DHS to connect with the “keepers of the secrets” in at least two other agencies. In these meetings, which took place in June-July 2011, Sacha, Jim, and colleagues were treated rudely and harshly. Bell and Mover were repeatedly told “no, and hell no.” This left Mover and Bell convinced that advanced technology was sequestered under government supervision at aerospace contractors’ facilities. As a result, the DHS officials became very hesitant and even fearful of moving forward. Perhaps Mover and Bell only belatedly realized the unique, game changing, and earth-shattering nature of the biggest secret ever kept by the United States. The vast implications of this secret may simply have paralyzed them. 

It’s possible that because DHS was a “new kid in town” and low on the traditional pecking order among long-established intelligence agencies that their requests were viewed as not worthy of serious consideration. After all, with the passage of the Homeland Security Act by Congress in November 2002 in response to devastatingly poor coordination between intelligence and law enforcement organizations seen in the wake of the September 2001 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security formally came into being as a stand-alone, Cabinet-level department to further coordinate and unify national homeland security efforts, opening its doors on March 1, 2003. Therefore, when Bell and Mover began knocking on doors to obtain additional evidence on sequestered advanced technology, the rudeness and hostility shown to them was not just an attempt to protect the greatest secret of all, but a marking of the territory for a young organization less than ten years old that dared to request access to something that had been successfully buried within the bowels of the United States Government for more than 60 years. 

Nevertheless Bell, Mover, and colleagues emerged from the June 2011 inter-agency meetings newly convinced that sequestered advanced technology was real and that they had a tiger by the tail in attempting to bring a new BAASS-like program under the DHS umbrella. 

From July to December 2011, the Science & Technology (S&T) group at DHS worked with BAASS to firm up the details of the proposed new BAASS-like organization that might be integrated into S&T. Multiple proposals were submitted, edited, discussed, and fine-tuned with Jim Lacatski acting as intermediary with DHS. The BAASS group were told that O’Toole was a positive proponent of this initiative, and by late 2011, the initiative had reached a point where a meeting of the leadership was to take place. 

The primary decision maker at DHS regarding integration of the BAASS-like program into DHS was Deputy Secretary Jane Holl Lute, who was second in command at the Department. Lute has since retired from DHS. In addition to Lute, there were three other main decision makers in upper DHS management. They were the Undersecretary of Management and the DHS General Counsel. A third very important participant in the decision-making process was then Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis Phyllis Green, who had a reputation as a consummate intelligence professional and a “no nonsense” senior decision maker at DHS. 

In November 2011, Jane Holl Lute was convinced that the proposed BAASS-like program “was a go.” But Phyllis Green was skeptical of the data that had been obtained by BAASS, and in particular she was concerned that the controversial BAASS subject matter, if it were ever made public, would bring disrepute to the DHS as a fledgling organization trying to be taken seriously by other government departments. Ultimately, Undersecretary Phyllis Green proved to be a powerful, logical voice in the small select group of DHS leadership, and the consensus decision emerged not to proceed with the BAASS-like program at DHS. BAASS was seen as too fringe. 

In the end it may have turned out for best. Under Secretary Phyllis Green’s vociferous insistence on not incorporating the BAASS program into DHS may have been the correct one.

Chapter 18: Post AAWSAP Events 

Cast a cold Eye on Life, On Death, Horseman, pass by.

Repeated efforts to find continued funding for AAWSAP from 2011 through 2016 by, at various times, Senators Harry Reid and Joe Lieberman, and Congressman Steny Hoyer, among others, ultimately failed. But the AAWSAP program, which ran from 2008 to 2010, and what happened during the decade that followed, directly led to the release of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) Report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on June 25, 2021. This chapter tells that story. 

The catalyst for the ultimate public reveal of the Pentagon programs were the 2015 and 2016 reports by naval aviators of increasing encounters with small UAPs within their operational areas. Those reports, which were centralized by AATIP, began to reach the public in December 2017 when The New York Times published its shocking, front-page scoop about the Pentagon’s secret investigation of UFOs; the story was written by Leslie Kean along with veteran journalists Ralph Blumenthal and Helene Cooper.

Kean was tipped off to the existence of the secret Pentagon UFO program by To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA), an organization interested in exploiting UAP technology founded by musician Tom DeLonge of Blink-182 and Angels and Airwaves fame. The main source for the Times article was Lue Elizondo, who had recently resigned from his Pentagon position and joined TTSA as Director of Global Security and Special Programs.

The story included interviews with Senator Harry Reid, who had secured the $22 million dollars in funding for a DIA-supervised private contract, and with Robert Bigelow, whose subsidiary company BAASS landed the contract and conducted the study under the overall acronym of AAWSAP. The Times story never mentioned AAWSAP. Rather, it mistakenly reported that the budget went to AATIP. In an accompanying article, former naval aviator Commander David Fravor, who in 2009 had been the primary witness interviewed by Axelrod while investigating the Tic Tac case, went public with details about his 2004 encounter. Pictures and videos of the Tic Tac event, as well as the more recent 2015 and 2016 small UAP encounters, were revealed and discussed. 

The Times story generated a tidal wave of interest among other news organizations. The Gray Lady’s coverage of this oft-maligned topic gave other news organizations the opening they needed to follow up the story. Politico reporter Bryan Bender unleashed his own AATIP story almost simultaneously with the Times piece. The Washington Post jumped in. TV networks picked it up. International news outlets ran their own front-page stories. Within just a few days, the UFO topic became somewhat respectable for journalists to pursue. Unfortunately, the AATIP details presented in these articles and news programs were actually those of AAWSAP and, in fact, many of those details themselves were in error. 

The absence of ridicule by the news media caught the attention of members of Congress. Within weeks, senior staff members of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees were requesting briefings. Closed-door briefings were arranged. Navy pilots told longtime congressional staffers about the impossible craft they had encountered. Elected members of Congress heard about the briefings and started asking to be included. For a subject long relegated to the tabloids and internet conspiracy theories, this represented a monumental shift.

Several other developments helped pave the way for the changes that are still unfolding, and most of those developments are linked, to one degree or another, with the foundational efforts that started in Las Vegas in the early 1990s.

Businessman Robert Bigelow’s decision to create NIDS in 1996 brought together many of the best minds to ever study the UFO mystery. The creation of NIDS and Bigelow’s purchase of Skinwalker Ranch caught the attention of Senator Harry Reid, who, more than a decade later as Senate Majority Leader, had the clout to secure funding for what became AAWSAP. Without Bigelow’s ownership of Skinwalker Ranch and the 2005 book Hunt for the Skinwalker about the NIDS investigation of that property, which in 2007 was read by both Lacatski and Axelrod, it is unlikely Lacatski would have been inspired to drive the creation of the AAWSAP program. 

The creation of AAWSAP and its pioneering investigation of the Tic Tac case with Axelrod and team was directly responsible for the later establishment of a smaller, corollary effort, called AATIP inside the Pentagon that focused exclusively on UAP encounter incidents involving US military personnel. The small cadre of UFO-curious military personnel occasionally consulted some of the same scientists who had worked with NIDS and BAASS. The core of that group formed the basis for what became the UAP Task Force, formally created by Congress in the summer of 2020 (but which had already been operating for a few years, despite not having a budget, an office, or a formal name). 

In the months and years after The New York Times helped kick off a wave of UFO/UAP related news coverage, other bits and pieces of information surfaced, including an unsigned, unofficial but comprehensive analysis of the Tic Tac incident, a report that began at AAWSAP, but which was prepared on behalf of, and forwarded to, DIA. 

From 2017 until the publication of the UAPTF Report in June 2021 the two most high-profile advocates for a government program to study UAPs were Christopher Mellon, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and Luis Elizondo. For four years Mellon and Elizondo were almost constant features in the media and their intensive campaign by June 2021 had begun to yield tangible results. 

A few other documents related to the creation of, and work product produced by, AAWSAP also leaked out to media organizations. And in the spring of 2021, the public saw new snippets of video footage and still photos recorded by Navy personnel on the East and West coasts, materials confirmed by the Pentagon as having been documented by the Navy and forwarded to the UAP Task Force. George Knapp of KLAS TV and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell coordinated the release of the images in the buildup to June 2021, the deadline for the Director of National Intelligence (and the UAP Task Force’s) much-anticipated report to Congress and the public regarding the UAP mystery.

Although the report proved a disappointment to many who had hoped it might amount to the holy grail of government “Disclosure” by revealing the possible presence of interdimensionals and/or space aliens, the fact Congress authorized such a report in the first place was a remarkable change from the ridicule and dismissals the UFO subject has received from journalists, scientists, the Pentagon, and elected officials over the years.

The seeds of this dramatic change were planted in the dusty desert soil of Las Vegas more than a quarter century ago. Those seeds were germinated by AAWSAP 13 years ago, grew up during the formation of the UAPTF, and burst into colorful bloom in June 25, 2021, when the UAPTF report was released.

Chapter 19:   
The Legacy of AAWSAP BAASS 

In the future, attention undoubtedly will be centered on the genome, with greater appreciation of its significance as a highly sensitive organ of the cell that monitors genomic activities and corrects common errors, senses unusual and unexpected events, and responds to them, often by restructuring the genome.

—Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize acceptance speech 198420

  


Since the publication of The New York Times article in December 2017 that outed what they called “the Pentagon’s Mysterious UFO program,” hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of words have been written about the once secret UAP investigation effort. But it was not the intent of the program, as originally proposed by Senators Reid, Inouye, and Stevens, to ever see the light of day.

One of the purposes of this book is to correct the record. The book was collaboratively written by James T Lacatski, the DIA Program Manager and Contracting Officer Representative; by Colm Kelleher, the Project Manager of the AAWSAP BAASS program in Las Vegas; and by George Knapp who was intimately involved in the NIDS program from 1996–2004, in UAP investigations since the late 1980s, and who was knowledgeable about the BAASS program from its inception. Two of these authors had direct day to day responsibility for the execution of the AAWSAP contract. There are no more authoritative voices regarding what was real and what was not about this unique government program. 

The Logic of the Broad Scope of AAWSAP Research

From its inception, the AAWSAP BAASS program intended to keep the scope of subjects for investigation as wide as possible with the understanding that narrowing the scope prematurely would result in a distorted dataset. The decision to research paranormal phenomena that co-locate with UAPs and to examine psychic effects in UAP witnesses, in addition to scrutinizing the core UAP technology itself, was not taken lightly because of the controversial nature of the UAP-paranormal debate. Strong voices existed both inside and outside DIA that argued AAWSAP should only focus on researching the technology of UAPs.

At the inception of the program, the AAWSAP principals both in Las Vegas and in Washington, D.C., were aware that in previous in-depth investigations the witnesses of core UAP technology also frequently reported paranormal fallout as well as psychic effects. When investigators took the trouble to repeatedly re-interview eyewitnesses, as trust was gained over multiple visits, witnesses began to surrender additional details of their experiences beyond encountering a metallic or solid-looking object. They frequently reported poltergeist effects, humanoid-shaped black shadows, loud footsteps, hauntings, discarnate voices, small flying orbs, or some combination thereof, in their homes. These people also regularly reported precognitive, clairvoyant, telepathic, or unusual electromagnetic phenomena, as well as occasional increases in meaningful coincidences in their lives in the aftermath of a UAP encounter.

When NIDS, AAWSAP, or other investigators interviewed eyewitnesses in Northeastern Utah, in Dulce, New Mexico, in the San Luis Valley, Colorado, around Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana, in Yakima, Washington, in the Hudson Valley, New York, or in “Marley Woods,” Missouri, the metallic UAP regularly occurred along with paranormal phenomena and psychic effects on witnesses. Without disclosing confidential information, the authors of this book can say that this pattern also applied to Tic Tac pilots as well as select members of AATIP.

This overlap between the “nuts and bolts” UAP phenomena and psychic aftereffects and paranormal consequences is not new. In fact, this has been known to occur since the 1940s. It has not been widely reported that Kenneth Arnold, who became known as the father of the modern UFO era after he reported seeing some chevron-shaped metallic objects emitting or reflecting light on June 24, 1947, also subsequently saw balls of light or orbs in his home as well as experienced a litany of paranormal events unfolding in his life after his epoch-making sighting. 

And we now learn of another 1940s episode through renowned astrophysicist and computer scientist Jacques Vallee whose book details the investigation of the alleged crash of a UAP in August 1945.21 The crash was located approximately 20 miles from the New Mexico Trinity test site where the first atomic bomb exploded. Vallee’s book contains twelve separate references to alleged “psychic effects” reported by the young eyewitnesses of the UAP crash. In the following excerpt from the book Vallee’s co-author, Paola Harris, interviews a witness (Reme Baca) to the crash:

Reme confirms to Paola that the situation was emotional, but something else comes into his recollection, something more than the realization that they’ve just watched an airplane crash. “Then we saw these pictures in our heads,” he says [italics original]. Surprised, she asks him to repeat the statement, and he confirms there were pictures, adding “I didn’t know what the heck they were. I can remember what they are, I got pictures, but I didn’t know what they meant then and I still don’t know. They must have known we were there.” That statement is important, because it marks the first instance of a kind of interaction between the phenomenon and its witnesses that may be fundamental to our eventual understanding of the UFO problem in general: Witnesses are an integral part of the event.21

If the 1945 crash really happened as Vallee and Harris report, and if the alleged “psychic effects” on the two eyewitnesses occurred, then we are looking at something truly remarkable. Alleged psychic effects on witnesses seeing UAPs were reported back in 1945, fully 76 years ago at the very beginning of the “modern UFO era.” 

Jeffrey Kripal, the J. Newton Rayzor Chair in Philosophy and Religious Thought at Rice University in Houston, brilliantly summarizes the critical tension that exists between the “nuts and bolts” and paranormal aspects of UAPs: 

“The difficult truth is that the UFO phenomenon has both an objective ‘hard’ aspect (think fighter jet videos, photographs, alleged metamaterials, apparent advanced propulsion methods, and landing marks) and a subjective ‘human’ aspect (think close encounters, multiple and coordinated visual sightings, altered states of consciousness, visionary displays, often of a most baroque or sci-fi sort, and experienced traumatic or transcendent abductions). And both sides—both the material and the mental dimensions—are incredibly important to get a sense of the full picture.”22

To use Dr. Kripal’s terminology, AAWSAP was determined to capture both the material and mental dimensions of UAPs.

Thus the AAWSAP program, catalyzed by Doug Kurth’s original January 7, 2009, report on his involvement with Tic Tac, which in turn was forwarded to Lacatski and utilized by Axelrod for his investigations, drove one of the most intensive inquiries in history of the USS Nimitz Tic Tac UAP case. But it is important to realize that the AAWSAP BAASS teams also investigated the paranormal events, such as those that took place at Skinwalker Ranch and in the Axelrod home, with the same single-minded determination as the team investigated the Tic Tac event. 

Human Effects

The AAWSAP team documented the effects on human health as a result of interacting with UAPs. Primarily the team pioneered the concept of focusing on the human body to research the effects of UAPs. From the very inception of the program, the research team placed a new emphasis on the human body as a readout system for examining the aftereffects of close encounters. Why? Because the human body, including the human immune system and the brain, are exquisitely sophisticated and sensitive information-processing systems that can be “perturbed” by outside influences, for example a close encounter with a UAP. Beginning in 2008, the AAWSAP scientific staff intuited that the record of that perturbation in the human body can sometimes be unmasked or decoded with the use of immunological, imaging, or chemical approaches. 

By examining the hematological, immunological, neuro-anatomical, and biochemical sequelae of close encounters in witnesses, AAWSAP scientists hypothesized that additional layers of the UAP/eyewitness interaction could potentially be unraveled. A good example of this pioneering and, in 2008, innovative approach was the examination of multiple serial blood samples obtained from biotechnologist Ron Becker and careful analysis of the perturbations on his immune system in the aftermath of experiencing his dramatic close encounter with blue orbs in Oregon. 

The intent of the AAWSAP scientific team was to build a multi-dimensional tapestry of physical consequences of the UAP close encounter on the individual that could be simultaneously matched against eyewitness testimony.

It must be emphasized that no human experimentation was conducted, and every aspect of HIPAA regulation was followed to the letter by all AAWSAP BAASS medical and scientific personnel. All MRI data were double blinded, witness confidentiality was strictly enforced, and the identities of witnesses were segregated in password protected files from all scientific data that was gathered. 

It should also be noted that in the intervening 11 years since the shutdown of AAWSAP in late 2010, members of what Jacques Vallee has termed the “Invisible College” (the network of highly credentialed scientists who have been working for decades on UAPs in secrecy because of the stigma attached to the topic) have taken this pioneering effort to the next level, conducting extremely detailed and state-of-the-art physiological research. The authors recognize that this research has been conducted in secret, and we will not compromise this secrecy in this book. 

In sum, these medical and scientific techniques that aimed to decode the effects of UAP close encounters on eyewitnesses began a new era in the study of UAPs starting in 2008.

The professionalism shown by both the DIA program staff and by the Las Vegas team during the program is noteworthy. This work was undertaken when the UAP topic was still verboten and toxic, and the stressful impact of working with such a toxic subject on mainstream scientists, engineers, and intelligence analysts should not be underestimated. 

Technically Rigorous Reporting

Since the advent of what is usually called “modern UFOlogy” in 1947, the history of the United States Government’s involvement in the UAP arena has not been a comfortable one. The initial forays of Project Sign (December 1947–February 1949) into investigating these unidentified objects were indeed based on science and serious investigations. Within less than two years, however, this serious scientific focus had begun to devolve into one with a more political and public relations emphasis with Project Grudge (February 1949–March 1952), followed by Project Blue Book (1952–1969). The stumbling attempts by the United States Air Force to engage with UAPs culminated in the embarrassment of the University of Colorado UFO project in 1969 that ended in confusion and acrimony with the publication of a report that was less than objective about the national security implications of UAPs flying in United States airspace. 

The University of Colorado project ended in a circus-like atmosphere with committee members resigning over the egregious lack of professionalism displayed by physicist Edward Condon, the project lead. The concomitant end of Project Bluebook in December 1969 brought to a close the public involvement of the United States Government with UFOs. The history of this faltering relationship of the United States Government with UAPs is summarized in painstaking detail in Michael Swords and Robert Powell’s UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry.23

Approximately 40 years later, the DIA’s re-engagement in UAP investigations was conducted in secrecy for good reason. The intent was to execute a series of sub rosa investigations to avoid the public hysteria that inevitably follows the UAP subject. The success of this approach was exemplified by the productivity of the AAWSAP BAASS teams in the form of the voluminous high-quality material submitted to the DIA in just over two years of the program’s existence. 

In fact, prior to the final transfer of the paper copies of the AAWSAP output to the Defense Intelligence Agency (electronic copies had already been submitted to DIA during 2008–2010), close to a hundred separate reports were organized into a series of three ringed binders in Kelleher’s office in Las Vegas. These binders stood over six feet tall, and the entire set was shipped to Defense Intelligence Agency Office in Washington, D.C., at the end of 2012. Thus, a significant part of the AAWSAP legacy was the prodigious output of thousands of pages of technically rigorous investigative reports on UAP and other anomalies utilizing scientific methodology. 

AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse

A significant achievement of the AAWSAP program was the successful development of the Data Warehouse. To accomplish this gargantuan task, AAWSAP BAASS hired ten people who spent the majority of their time, forty hours per week, developing it. The AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse broke new ground because it included several new databases developed specifically by AAWSAP BAASS, databases from sources never collectively analyzed, which were then incorporated into a format that covered all the layers of information associated with UAP events. 

The Data Warehouse comprised eleven separate databases and their associated supporting documentation in electronic format—such as witness interviews, photographs, videos, recordings, sketches, analytical reports, and more. Each of the databases contained UAP sighting events that related to the purpose of that particular database, although some of the reported cases did overlap.

The eleven databases included in the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse were: (1) NIDS Database, (2) Airline and Military Pilot Database, (3) Project Sign/Grudge/Blue Book Database, (4) UFOCAT Database, (5) MUFON Case Management System Database, (6) Project Colares Database, (7) Canadian Government UAP Release Database, (8) United Kingdom Government UAP Release Database, (9) AAWSAP BAASS Database of cases investigated internally 2008-2010, (10) Skinwalker Ranch Database, and (11) An “eyes only” database documenting physiological effects from individuals who had spent time on the Skinwalker Ranch. 

The AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse is an electronic repository for historical, ongoing, and future UAP reporting and investigations. It was designed to facilitate sophisticated analyses and data mining to improve the understanding of the extent, structure, and frequency of unusual aerial phenomena, as well as their potential correlation to known physical, environmental, biological, or socio-political factors. The primary consultant behind the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse was Jacques Vallee. There was a very large input into the creation of the database by investigators, MUFON, database experts, French and Portuguese translators, and scientific analysts for scrubbing data prior to data entry. The database was also populated with scrubbed cases from Danish, Brazilian (Brazilian translators), French (translated from French), as well as Canadian and British cases. Additionally, the AAWSAP database format captured administrative details associated with the UAP event, such as witness information, location, date, time, duration, etc. This yielded arguably one of the most comprehensive UAP databases in the world. 

Each case that went into the Data Warehouse was allocated an index of credibility (SVP) and was assigned a Vallee classification number. (For a thorough methodological description of the SVP and Vallee Classification Number, see Confrontations: A Scientist’s Search for Alien Contact.24) The foundational configuration of the database format was based upon the “Six Layer Model for Anomalous Phenomena” developed by Jacques Vallee and Eric Davis.2 This six-layer model encapsulated all of the potential characteristics of UAP events that can be studied. It includes:

1) The Physical Layer: those physical characteristics associated with a UAP event

2) The Anti-Physical Layer: the patterns that conflict with those predicted in modern physics 

3) The Psychological Layer: the psychological impacts to the witness(es) and the social conditions that surround them

4) The Physiological Layer: the effects perceived by humans

5) The Psychic Layer: the effects commonly found in parapsychology literature

6) The Cultural Layer: the primary and secondary effects upon society. 

Inherent in the six-layer design of the database was extensive focus on the UAP effects on humans. The six-layer model published by Vallee and Davis included both the physical layer (layer 1), but also the effects on the human being (layers 3–6). It cannot be overstated that any major study on UAPS going forward MUST include all six layers, otherwise, the entire picture of the UAP encounter cannot be properly understood. 

For example, there will be a strong temptation in 2021 and in subsequent UAPTF investigations of military pilot encounters with UAPs to focus ONLY on sensor derived data (layer 1) in the name of “national security” or “congressional mandates” and ignoring layers 3–6 (the effects on witnesses). Already, disparaging comments about “things that go bump in the night” are being levelled in the media at suggestions to broaden the scope of UAP investigations. But for the UAPTF to focus only on level 1 investigations is to ignore the voluminous data on UAP interactions that have been collected globally since 1945. 

The authors are aware that the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse, rather than lying fallow in a dusty warehouse or on a discarded hard drive, has been recently reactivated and is currently in use in various locations related to the government study of UAPs. The significant advantage of the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse architecture was its modular design. This means that current users can utilize individual databases while adding or discarding others. At the cessation of the AAWSAP program, an enhanced analytical layer was about to be overlaid on the database with the intent to eventually incorporate an AI interrogation capability. This feature has now been added to the upgraded AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse and is a useful tool in beefing up the UAP analytical capability of the UAPTF.

What is in Appendix I?

Appendix I provides a full list of the titles of the AAWSAP BAASS reports submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency in fulfillment of the AAWSAP contract. This lengthy list encapsulates the full breadth and scope of the United States Government AAWSAP BAASS effort. Contained within this Appendix lies the evidence that the scope of the DIA funded program encompassed investigation of injuries caused by blue orbs, investigation of poltergeist-like activity in a household in Indiana, the full report of a remote viewing tasking made by famed remote viewer Joe McMoneagle on Skinwalker Ranch, research reports on UAP activity incursions on USAF missile bases, and Skinwalker Ranch investigations. 

The Final Report summarizing the findings of the AAWSAP BAASS program was delivered to DIA in September of 2010. The report stated bluntly that the UAP phenomenon is a threat to human health and well-being. The AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse comprised many hundreds of UAP-human interactions that were classified as close encounters involving injury or death to the witness.

The AAWSAP final report acknowledges that many of the cases that comprise the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse were gathered by third parties from around the world. Nevertheless, there are many hundreds of close encounter cases in the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse that described pathological effects as a result of UAP-human interactions. Thus, the data in the AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse are fully consistent with the main thrust of the AAWSAP Final Report that there is a correlation between UAP activity and threat to human well-being. 

It is crucially important to distinguish here between a threat to human health versus a threat to humans. The AAWSAP Threat Analysis Report suggested that the phenomenon was a threat to human health, which does not imply “intent” on the part of UAPs. Human beings may simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time and still be injured by the phenomenon. A good example is the blue orb that went through Becker’s body (Chapter 8) and caused injury as he drove his car towards Bend, Oregon. The threat to Becker’s health and well-being was independent of the “intent” of the blue orb.

Axelrod and Kelleher had many discussions about the definition of a human threat from the DoD perspective. While Kelleher proposed that the ability of the Tic Tac to easily out-maneuver the best technology that the United States military could deploy meant that the Tic Tac, by definition, was a threat to United States national security, a threat from the United States Government’s perspective must have unambiguous evidence of BOTH capability AND intent. While there is 75 years’ worth of circumstantial evidence on the capabilities of the phenomenon, there is still almost no evidence regarding the intent or the agenda of UAPs. Hence, there is simply too little evidence for DoD to formally define the UAP as a threat to humans.

Only by gaining access to the complete content of the reports and papers that AAWSAP BAASS submitted to the Defense Intelligence Agency will the public be able to evaluate the breadth and scope of the program. The authors believe that the totality of the 109 documents in the possession of the DIA gives insight into the program’s accomplishments and forward progress in validating and understanding the UAP and related paranormal phenomena.

Epilogue

They are the warriors of total freedom, they are such masters of awareness, stalking and intent that they are not caught by death, like the rest of mortal men, but choose the moment and the way of their departure from this world. At that moment they are consumed by a fire from within and vanish from the face of the earth, free, as if they had never existed.

Some of the principals and “brain trust” that came together to create AAWSAP in 2008 have studied the modern history of the UFO phenomenon from 1947–2021. Because of this, as recounted in this book, the design of AAWSAP programs and projects took the broad tapestry of modern UFO interactions with humanity into account, and fundamentally this broad focus is what differentiated AAWSAP from AATIP.

Is it possible to place the AAWSAP into the context of the 75-year history of the modern UFO phenomenon, which is global? 

This history is replete with twists and turns and appears to have loosely unfolded in six putative phases from 1947–2021. We have no idea whether these six phases are connected, or whether they are unconnected and simply occurred in a random, rough chronological sequence. From our perspective it is the effects of these phases that are important.

Phase 1: Beginning on June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold witnessed a fleet of nine seemingly metallic UAPs moving at high speed near Mount Rainier in Washington state, and five weeks later he reported that a group of 20 to 25 small copper-colored objects flew directly at his aircraft.26 Thus, the age of modern UFOs began with a bang, with numerous sightings of large numbers of UAPs flying together, sometimes in formation. The UFO armada that flew over Farmington, New Mexico, during March 16–18, 1950,27 is not as famous as the two large fleets of UFOs that flew directly over Washington, D.C., both in July 1952 (known as the “Washington merry go round encounters”23). The armadas of UFOs occurred in parallel with an explosion of thousands of reports of individual craft sightings. 

Phase 2: Almost from the beginning of the UFO era (1949 onwards), curious and bizarre episodes began to unfold in the United States in which ordinary people claimed that they had met and interacted with the pilots of flying saucers and, in some cases, had been taken aboard the craft and had flown to various exotic locations. These people brought messages from the ufonauts that warned against nuclear war and destruction of the environment, or dispensed spiritual advice to humans. 

Known as the “contactee” movement, people such as George Adamski, George Van Tassel, Orfeo Angelucci, and Truman Bethurum had become household names by the 1950s and 1960s and had attracted tens of thousands of followers into new, quasi-religious groups that preached a message of brotherly love from the “space brothers.”28

By the late 1960s, the contactees had largely been dismissed as charlatans and hoaxers, but as recounted by Jacques Vallee,29 they and their various religious and cult organizations had created a deep, long-lasting counterculture that rippled through the collective human psyche, particularly in North America.

Phase 3: Even as the intensity of the contactee movement began to die down by the 1970s, and as the various waves of UFOs still dominated global headlines, the phenomenon had morphed into what could be construed as a targeted assault on dozens of USAF bases, particularly those that housed nuclear Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). 

As thoroughly documented by Robert Hastings,14 hundreds of separate UFO incidents occurred on the most sensitive missile bases in the world, both in the US and in the Soviet Union. In a small number of extremely well documented incidents, UFOs were known to have sabotaged the launch control sequences for missiles at Malmstrom Air Force base in Montana in 196730 as well as missiles located in the Soviet Union. During the 1960s and 1970s, UFOs flew with impunity over Loring AFB in Maine, Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan, Minot AFB in North Dakota,31 and Malmstrom AFB in Montana. These incursions appeared to catch the United States military’s early warning systems completely by surprise. 

Phase 4: The 1960s through 1980s were replete with reports from eyewitnesses of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” (CE III) in which observers claimed to see, interact with, and converse with the “pilots” of the flying saucers. Thousands of CEIII were documented globally, but by the 1980s a new, more disturbing phenomenon was being reported. Witnesses claimed that they were being abducted against their will by the denizens of UFOs and, in many cases, subjected to forcible, sometimes painful, and terrifying medical procedures while onboard the UFOs. 

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, authors such as Pulitzer Prize winning psychiatrist John Mack,32,33 New York artist Budd Hopkins,34 and Temple University historian David Jacobs35 published several books that electrified and terrified the public in North America and in Europe. These books documented the widespread kidnapping of frightened citizens from their homes or from their cars; they were then transported against their will to laboratory-like locations where invasive, painful, and brutal medical procedures were performed on them while being held captive, presumably inside the UFO craft. 

Horror novelist Whitley Strieber’s Communion,36 published in 1987, recounted his graphic abduction by beings he called “the visitors.” Strieber’s book described a brutal attack that subsequently left him hospitalized. Communion quickly became a cultural and media sensation and was a New York Times #1 Bestseller. The front cover contained an arresting, mesmerizing image of an alien with large, black, hypnotic, almond-shaped eyes that quickly became the iconic cultural image of what aliens would look like in TV shows and movies for decades to come. 

By the end of the 1990s and as the new millennium dawned, the reality of “alien abductions” as objective events began to be questioned by many, especially as many of the stories had emerged from non-clinical hypnosis procedures conducted by amateurs. Regardless, by 2010, the consensus among UFO researchers was that “something” anomalous had happened to UFO abductees, and that their reports of being abducted from their cars and their bedrooms had some basis in a “real” experience. 

Phase 5: Overlaid upon the abduction phenomenon during the 1990s and 2000s was a rapid escalation of thousands of reports of mysterious black triangles of unknown origin in the United States and in Europe. These silent craft tended to be huge and brightly lit, flying at very low altitudes (treetop level) above populated neighborhoods and over Interstate highways. Many dismissed these triangles as top-secret United States experimental aircraft. But if this were the case, the craft were violating dozens of air safety regulations by repeatedly flying at low altitudes over densely inhabited areas. If they were not a Special Access Program of the US military, the agenda of these huge craft is anybody’s guess.

Phase 6: After 2010, the frequency of black triangle sightings began to diminish. But the world now knows that since 2004, then escalating during 2014–2015 and continuing through 2021, UFOs, which were now being called UAPs, were routinely interacting with high performance combat aircraft from the United States Navy and with multiple United States military ships and aircraft carriers on both the East and West coasts. 

Whether or not these six roughly chronological phases collectively constitute an obscure agenda by a single phenomenon, their cumulative unfolding has had profound effects on western human society since 1947. One question that arises from these six phases: Is someone trying to tell us something? Does consciousness have something to do with it?

In the last ten years a growing number of highly respected scientists from multiple disciplines have begun to question the nature of human consciousness. This small, but very influential group has aggressively pushed back against the hundred-year dogma in biology and in neuroscience that consciousness is a consequence of, and emerges from, neurochemical trafficking in the brain. 

Bernardo Kastrup, a scientist from the Netherlands with a PhD in computer science and a second PhD in philosophy, has been one of the more outspoken members of this group. In several books and articles,37,38 Kastrup powerfully argues that consciousness is primary and gives rise to physical reality, not the other way around. These arguments essentially turn a century of dogma that has pervaded every level of science and of policy making on its head.

Other eminent scientists, such as Edward Kelly at University of Virginia,39 renowned microprocessor inventor Federico Faggin,11 Rice University’s Jeffrey Kripal,40 and stem cell biologist Robert Lanza41,42 are pioneering a revolutionary new way of looking at human consciousness. This multi-disciplinary assault on the old materialistic views of science will have long lasting effects on the science of consciousness going forward. 

This intellectual insurgency may even extend into how we view UAPs. 

Each of the six phases of the phenomenon, as they slowly unfolded globally from 1947 to 2021, may have had separate and distinct impacts on human society.

Firstly, the continuous waves of UFO sightings have impacted literally millions of individual eyewitnesses who have had their worldview turned upside down. Secondly, consider the profound cultural consequences of the ripple effects from claims of encounters with “extraterrestrials” named Orthon, Aura Rhanes, or Diana by the contactees. 

We may never know how the UAP became the worst nightmare of the military-industrial complex as they secretly grappled with the enormous calamity of hundreds of blatant UAP intrusions into the airspace over their Air Force bases and Navy ships, and with the sabotaging of some ICBMs during 1960s-1980s. To what extent did these intrusions engender a feeling of helplessness at multiple levels of the chains of military command? 

And finally, what about the impact of the more than two-decade-long assault on an estimated hundreds of thousands of abductees and on their families through multiple generations? 

In 2021 it is difficult to evaluate the jarring ontological shock that has been visited upon a mainly materialist, physicalist human society by the UAP over the past 75 years. 

Without having some consensus understanding on what constitutes human consciousness, collectively we have no idea about just how profound the shakeup caused by these mysterious phenomena has been on human consciousness, or ultimately what their future impact on humans will be.

Appendix II: AAWSAP BAASS Organizational Structure/A New AAWSAP-Like Program

How do we capitalize on the productivity of the AAWSAP BAASS program that lasted a mere two years? The original intent from Senator Reid and others was to provide the resources for a five-year program with annual increases in funding. Imagine what AAWSAP BAASS could have achieved if the program had been allowed to continue for five years instead of the abrupt termination that occurred after only two years.

One of the advantages that AAWSAP BAASS created was the novel capability to include multiple simultaneous varied data collection streams without prematurely stove piping the effort. This initial broad-spectrum data collection was a crucial and deliberate strategy orchestrated from the beginning of the AAWSAP BAASS program. 

If an organization focuses only on data collection from airline pilots or military pilots, the overall interpretation of the data will be handcuffed. Likewise, if an organization is created solely for the purpose of collecting data on “paranormal” phenomena, only a narrow (and selection biased) pipeline of data would result, with all other data excluded.

A central question in proposing a new program is: where is the money going to come from? We propose that the program must be supported from private funding. As the authors and others have experienced, funding in government programs tends to be subject to a wide variety of unstable political winds, and in an environment where legislative gridlock and annual Continuing Resolutions are the norm, it is doubtful whether a government funded program on such a controversial topic would survive. 

The shining examples of privately funded research come from two individuals—Robert T. Bigelow and Prince Hans Adam of Liechtenstein. Bigelow’s funding of the National Institute for Discovery Science for eight years was an example of how private funding can lead to groundbreaking research. Likewise, Prince Hans Adam of Liechtenstein provided a stable pipeline of funding over decades for a variety of programs both in Europe and in North America. 

Therefore, what follows is an attempt to apply the “lessons learned” from the AAWSAP BAASS program in assisting those interested in forming a new program to continue in these footsteps. AAWSAP BAASS successfully conducted efforts in all seven departments described.

To fully embrace the broad data collection efforts started by the DIA program, we propose that a privately funded research program could start small but eventually grow into a large organization comprising seven departments.

In each of the seven Departments, a Program Manager would play roles that involve hiring Department personnel, management of day-to-day operations and strategic decision making and guidance. AAWSAP BAASS successfully conducted efforts in all of the seven multidiscipline departments described below. The departments depict the organizational structure under which AAWSAP BAASS operated in support of DIA:

(1) Three Experimental Divisions overseeing three separate UAP “Hot spots”

(2) Data Collection Department

(3) Data Analysis Department 

(4) Advanced Technology Department 

(5) Consciousness Department 

(6) Medical Department 

(7) Integrative Research Department

1. Three Experimental Departments (UAP Hot Spots)

Currently there exist two or three well-studied experimental locations in the SW United States involving a high density of UAP sightings, one of which has been intensively researched for over two decades. The three areas include the Uinta Basin, Utah (not necessarily including Skinwalker ranch); Dulce, Northern New Mexico; and the San Luis Valley, Colorado. The proposed intent is to subject these sites to intensive study using strategy and tactics that have been successfully calibrated, iteratively improved, and deployed in one location in NE Utah. This includes engaging in all three locations the following objectives:

• Deploy sensor assets utilizing state-of-the-art sensor and data collection technology. 

• 24-hour, 7-day deployment of small teams (2-3 people) of personnel and biosensors (dogs) to sense, monitor, record, and report advanced aerospace vehicle and technology anomalies.

• Obtain/collect (when possible) multiple biological samples from these locations and subject them to genetic, biochemical, material science, toxicology, and other analyses.

• Within each location, focus remote viewing capabilities on all known hot spots (locations with repeated/frequent reports of activity).

• Deploy especially adaptive people as human interactive agents to all locations and retrieve maximum data on all interactions. 

• Maintain 7 day-24-hour low-profile security at above-described experimental locations.

2. Data Collection Department

The Data Collection Department will collect and deliver reports from the United States regarding sightings, evidence collection, and subsequent laboratory analysis on advanced technology behavior within the territorial limits of the United States and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The primary investigative unit will have the responsibility to:

• Utilize a team of in-house rapid-reaction investigators to investigate eyewitness cases involving Advanced Aerospace Vehicle (AAV) technology with the following criteria: (a) more than one eyewitness (b) less than 600 feet from witness or unusually large (i.e. aircraft carrier size) (c) physical evidence (traces on ground/vegetation), (d) electromagnetic effects, (e) physiological/medical/psychological effects 

• Expand the investigative equipment inventory necessary to fully equip an investigative team 

• When deemed an opportunity and properly managed, selected investigations may be outsourced to other carefully chosen professional groups with long, calibrated, experience in AAV investigations. This will increase data collection coverage of these events in the United States. It will also increase acquisition of new AAV cases.

• Expand liaison department with rural law enforcement (highway patrol, sheriff departments, police departments), US Coastguard (under DHS auspices), US border surveillance (under DHS auspices), US Fish and Wildlife Service (under Dept. of Interior), Park Game wardens (under National Park Service), and Federal Aviation Administration (AAWSAP BAASS system included all air traffic control and commercial/private aircraft pilots). The objective is to receive sighting reports quickly after the event from all above agencies.

• Utilize existing experience and history of success

3\. Data Analysis Department

• Both AAWSAP BAASS Program Managers, Kelleher and Lacatski have already acquired extensive relevant data on the program topics. As documented in this book, an extensive data warehouse currently exists; both paper copies and electronic copies were delivered to the Defense Intelligence Agency. 

• After acquisition of the data warehouse (which when delivered to DIA, comprised 11 separate databases with over 200,000 UAP reports—see Appendix I for more details) expand the capabilities by maximizing addition of new documented cases within each of the eleven databases. 

• Upgrade the database analysis capabilities to maximize “searchability” and pattern recognition/analysis. This entails several software and hardware upgrades to the current database configurations.

• Expand in-house photographic analysis capabilities (including, but not limited to, Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) analysis).

• Obtain historical, recent cockpit recordings and ECM recordings from AFOSI, Air Force, Navy, Marine, NASIC archives and current chain of command. 

• Obtain records, reports, raw data, and threat analyses pertaining to (but not limited to): advanced aerospace vehicle tracking by any agency or armed service within CONUS, all data from Low Earth Orbit (LEO), both historical and contemporary from NASA, GEO (e.g. USAF DSP satellites that routinely track Fastwalkers, analysis of which is conducted at The Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, CA), and LEO satellite data on unknown targets from USAF, NRO, other uncorrelated imagery data from NGIA, trajectory tracks of uncorrelated targets from NORAD/NorthCom/MIT Lincoln Labs etc., radar track records of uncorrelated targets from FAA, and all data (historical and contemporary) pertaining to interactions/sightings of UAPs at missile sites, nuclear weapons storage facilities, and at Air Force bases in CONUS. 

• Data analysis exchange with AFOSI (already initiated by Kelleher and Lacatski in face-to-face meeting with AFOSI-PJ personnel at Bolling AFB in 2010—see Chapter 11). 

• Data collection from an already identified and calibrated list of retired, previously highly placed government, armed services, contractor and intelligence community individuals. The oral history project will include gathering all information pertaining to the historical collection of data on advanced aerospace technology and biological samples, including records, files, reports, photographs, as well as physical samples of recovered technology and biological tissue. 

• Oral history of selected individuals will also include collection of information (including classified reports) on all government and government agency activities in relation to the performance and behavior of advanced aerospace vehicles in CONUS air space since 1947. Such reports will include, but will not be limited to: (a) reports, photographs, other imagery, physical samples pertaining to investigations of all AAV cases that were NOT included in Projects SIGN, GRUDGE, and Blue Book, (b) all investigation reports of AAV activity in the vicinity of Air Force bases and nuclear weapons storage areas, (c) investigations and reports pertaining to AAV activities in other countries, (d) all information regarding recovery of crashed AAVs in other countries.

4\. Advanced Technology Department

The Advanced Technology Department (ATC) would focus on gathering (a) reports and (b) physical samples of very advanced technologies which, according to the public record, are in the custody of certain aerospace and government contractors as well as other government sources. Another major objective of the ATC is to extend the analysis of this putative technology beyond the present limits as a means of developing novel countermeasures to future technological threats. Many of these concepts have been discussed with multiple private sector companies and civilian sector leadership.

An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of previous research would be conducted on the above-described advanced technology material. Implicit in this first report would be the capability of the Advanced Technology Department to create horizontal linkages between the vertical stovepipes that currently exist in the Intelligence Agencies and within multiple aerospace corporations. 

Since much of the analysis previously conducted by aerospace corporations is decades old, a re-analysis with more modern equipment and technology will be necessary under the auspices of the Advanced Technology Department. 

5. Consciousness Department

It is considered imperative to determine what can be learned, analyzed, and evaluated with regard to the putative consciousness connection between UAPs and humans.

Decades of field research by AAWSAP BAASS, NIDS, and multiple other organizations has suggested that consciousness (including telepathic communication) may play an integral role in human-UAP interactions. Many human eyewitnesses have interacted with allegedly non-human intelligences in many different countries and many of these interactions present with an intriguing commonality. The Consciousness Department is proposed to be an umbrella organization that houses multiple programs involving telepathy, remote viewing, psychic functioning, and more. It is thus very high value as an important tool to obtain critical data with regard to the activity and behavior of UAPs. 

6\. Medical Department

• Create a comprehensive database on all physiological and medical effects of Advanced Aerospace Vehicles (AAVs) within CONUS. The database will have pattern analysis and correlative capabilities.

• Create rapid response team of in-house physician-scientist personnel that, under the supervision of contract physician and deputy administrator, can rapidly conduct MRI (3 Tesla) scans, rapidly conduct appropriate blood tests (chemistry, hematology, toxicology, immune system), genetic tests (including tissue biopsies, blood sampling), cytogenetic analysis, and full forensic internal medicine diagnostic procedures and integrate the data into a “big picture” description of the putative aerospace vehicle associated injury. Since to date, some evidence in the public domain points to non-ionizing (EM) radiation associated injuries, emphasis will be on rapid reaction and timely sampling, utilizing the above described and other appropriate tests. 

• The rapid response medical team as described above will also monitor and test family members in the aftermath of UAP interactions. 

• An in-house PhD psychologist will conduct appropriate cognitive and other tests on individuals involved in the Medical Department research. This will include but will not be limited to: (a) individuals who have had experiences on any of the properties described in the Experimental Department, (b) individuals who have had close encounters with UAPs with physiological/medical effects, (c) family members of either of these groups who have reported subsequent physiological/medical effects.

• The medical team will be responsible for continuous monitoring of personnel and their family members deployed on experimental facilities and ranch areas.

• Expand and reconfigure current preliminary correlation project between known UAP associated injuries / physiological effects. 

• Create the internal infrastructure, organization, and personnel, as well as appropriately cleared contract research experts to handle, examine, and research unusual and unique biological specimens from the forensic, anatomic, physiological, biochemical, and genetic levels. Such data also will be systematized and integrated.

• Recruit a small team of medico-analysts under the direction of the chief physician and the program manager that will organize the data into a threat analysis based on medical findings, including but not limited to: (a) deaths and injuries as a result of interaction with AAVs, (b) medical injuries as a result of other anomalies, (c) collateral injuries/physiological effects to family members. 

• Create the infrastructure that will conform to all HIPAA and human subjects’ regulations as they pertain to the above Medical Department objectives.

• Create comprehensive database on physiological and medical effects of AAVs in other countries. The database will have advanced pattern analysis and correlative capabilities.

7. Integrative Research Department

The objective of the Integrative Research Department is to collate, integrate, and synthesize all high value information coming from the Data Collection, Experimental, Consciousness, and Medical Departments. The objective is to select, analyze, and report on the most important information from all data sources that pertain to a threat to National security from the deployment of advanced aerospace technology.

Appendix III: Materials and Methods: AAWSAP BAASS Equipment and Experimental Approaches

Environmental Monitoring Equipment Deployed on Skinwalker Ranch

Aaronia Spectran Handheld Spectrum Analyzers (NF-5030 and HF-60100) 

The process for spectrum analysis is broken into two distinct sections, the magnetic field measurements with the NF-5030 and electric field measurements with the HF-60100. Both were handheld devices chosen for their portability, their ruggedness, and by the fact that they could easily be operated in field conditions by a team of two scientists. 

Thermo Scientific Niton XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence)

Again, the Niton XRF was chosen for its portability and its ability to analyze the chemistry of soil samples on the ranch by measuring the spectrum of the characteristic x-rays emitted by the different elements in the sample when it is illuminated by x-rays. This handheld device was very useful in mapping out the elemental analysis of the soil throughout Skinwalker Ranch. 

By simultaneously measuring the fluorescent x-rays emitted by the different elements in the sample, handheld Thermo Scientific Niton XRF analyzers rapidly determined the elements present in the sample and their relative concentrations—in other words, the elemental chemistry of the sample.

Canberra Colibri Geiger Counter and SABG-100

The Canberra Colibri was chosen for Skinwalker Ranch measurements because it is a very versatile survey meter. It features excellent ergonomics such as easy handling, provides visual and audible alarms, and has an internal vibrator. The SABG-100 probe for measurement of surface contamination is designed to be used with any CSP survey meter. The phoswich detector with 100 cm2 detection area makes it an ideal tool for direct measurement of alpha, beta, and gamma emitters.

ANSYS Multiphysics FEA

The ANSYS Workbench platform is a powerful multidomain simulation environment that harnesses the core physics from ANSYS, enables their interoperability, and provides common tools for interfacing with CAD, repairing geometry, creating meshes and post-processing results.

Hardware for ANSYS Workbench Platform

The research and work performed by BAASS ranged from technical design and prototyping, all the way up to advanced theoretical and computational studies of partial differential equations describing multiphysics problems. Back in 2009, an expandable twelve-core Hewlett Packard server with 48 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage was used to perform parallel processing solutions for structural, fluid flow, heat transfer, high and low frequency electromagnetic problems, along with coupled physics of two or more of those listed previously.

Skinwalker Ranch Plant Experiments—Technical Details

Chapter 14 outlines the experimental intent of deploying plants on Skinwalker Ranch. The following are the technical details:

These plants served as biosensors for the presence of various types of radiation and/or chemicals/materials that can damage DNA. Three of each plant were placed in two different locations (living room and bedroom) under grow lights which were set to cycle through 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark daily. 

Tobacco heterozygous for the sulfur mutation (Su/+): This assay was based on a naturally occurring mutation at the Sulfur (Su) gene. Plants heterozygous for the gene, Su/+ are pale green. Mutations that inactivate only the Su allele were visualized as dark green spots while mutations of the wild type allele result in an albino spot (yellow/white). Heterozygous plants were required for the bioassay. Initially the plants were grown inside the Command and Control trailer and assayed for color spot changes. Once weather conditions at the ranch allowed, plants were moved to outside locations, in pots or planted directly in the ground. BAASS biologist Amanda Kruse inspected all tobacco leaves for the presence of dark green spots. 

Spiderwort: This assay consisted of microscopic observation of stamen hairs for alterations in hair cell coloration from blue to pink. This indicated a mutation inactivating the dominant blue color allele allowing expression of the recessive pink color allele. Additionally, pink spots were also to be assayed in the flower petals. This assay required microscopic observation. 

Skinwalker Ranch Seed Experiments—Technical Details

Plants were grown to determine if differences exist in germination rate and/or growth rate between the three locations as outlined in Chapter 14. Two types of seeds were grown in each location: Stokes Sugar Snap Peas and Stokes Green Beans. Both seed types were treated with fungicide to control contamination by fungus. All plant locations were watered with distilled water. Specialized containers known as “cone-tainers”—elongated pots arranged in a rack for optimal use of space—were used. This approach allowed the plants to grow for longer periods of time in order to assess growth. Two seed types were planted on each tray allowing for 49 of each seed type to be grown. The cone-tainers were placed under Jump Start T5 Grow Light systems to control the light cycles at each location. Timers were set on the light systems to provide 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark. To control for extraneous light, large enclosures were placed over the grow light systems. The amount of light was therefore consistent.

Approaches to Environmental Monitoring on   
Skinwalker Ranch

Due to anecdotal evidence presented on the TV show The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, numerous gamma ray measurements were re-examined that had been made with a Canberra Colibri Geiger Counter during the AAWSAP BAASS tours of duty in 2009 and early 2010. The Colibri TTC integrated a Geiger-Muller (GM) detector processed by a Time To Count (TTC) algorithm. This algorithm extends the detection range of the GM up to 10 Sv/h (1000 rem/h). For Skinwalker Ranch measurements, the Colibri displayed both the internal GM dose rate in fast reacting semi-log bar graph and an averaged digital reading. Colibri simultaneously displays the dose rate and the integrated dose. When an external probe is connected, it displays the external probe measurement and the dose rate from the internal detector.

Gamma radiation measurements were obtained utilizing the following grid map of Skinwalker ranch.

Appendix IV: Background on Skinwalker Ranch

A picturesque, 480-acre ranch property in northeastern Utah’s Uintah Basin played a pivotal role in the creation of AAWSAP, BAASS, and—eventually—AATIP and the UAP Task Force. The property, now known worldwide by its nickname Skinwalker Ranch, is likely the most intensely studied UFO and paranormal hotspot in the world.

Unidentified aerial phenomena have been reported in the skies of the Uinta Basin for close to a century, and possibly since the first Europeans arrived in the late 1700s. In the 1960s and 1970s, UFO reports became so common that local law enforcement agencies stopped recording them. A respected educator named Joseph “Junior” Hicks became the unofficial UFO historian for the region and personally investigated hundreds of UFO reports. His notes and witness statements documenting remarkable close encounter incidents were transformed into a highly regarded book The Utah UFO Display43 written by Utah State University professor Frank Salisbury, with a foreword by famed UFO pioneer Dr. J. Allen Hynek.

UFO sightings were the most obvious examples of what later emerged as a much broader range of unusual phenomena in the basin, and the Skinwalker Ranch property eventually became the focal point of multiple investigations. One credible eyewitness to unexplained phenomena on the ranch and throughout the basin was a veteran lawman named Pete Pickup. Pickup spent 26 years patrolling the backroads and ranch lands of the basin. Pickup personally investigated dozens of sighting reports, as well as multiple cattle mutilation incidents, and he and his wife witnessed unidentified lights and craft, including those seen over the property where he would later work as a private investigator, Skinwalker Ranch. In the early 2000s, Pickup told the authors that he believed an extraterrestrial intelligence was responsible for both the UFO sightings and the animal mutilations.

In 1996, a newspaper article which mentioned UFO incidents in and around the ranch caught the attention of Las Vegas businessman Robert Bigelow. Bigelow flew to Utah, met with the rancher, and quickly purchased the property. The rancher, his wife, and two teenage children told Bigelow that UFO sightings were only a small part of the sometimes-menacing phenomena that had besieged and bedeviled the family during the 20 months since they purchased what they hoped would be their permanent home.

According to the family members (pseudonym The Gormans), they had been psychologically tormented and physically intimidated by a bizarre range of paranormal phenomena, including poltergeist-type events inside the ranch house, objects disappearing and the reappearing in odd places, doors and windows opening and closing on their own, heavy footsteps heard outside their windows and later inside the home, huge shadowy humanoid figures that lurked outside their windows, disembodied voices emanating from the sky at night, mysterious beams of light that came from the sky (sometimes out of the ground) and illuminated pastures, and metallic clangs and strong rumbles emanating from underground, as if they stood atop an underground rail line or steel mill. Illuminated orbs larger than a softball, some white, some red, some blue, terrified their livestock as well as family members. Multiple unknown aircraft floated silently above the ranch at night.

The family saw animals that could not be identified, including a muscular hyena with a prominently bushy tail that was observed attacking one of their horses, and an unusually large wolf that attacked one of their calves and was shot five times by the rancher but walked away as if unscathed by the powerful bullets. The rancher suspected that some sort of rogue government agency wanted him off the property, but the events that followed seemingly defied anything government operatives could pull off. Expensive cattle began to disappear. Cats and dogs were mutilated, and other dogs were reduced to greasy puddles in the grass. A calf was stripped of all flesh and blood in broad daylight in total silence while the rancher and his wife were yards away in the same pasture. Four huge bulls were somehow moved from a corral into a cramped tool shed without the only entrance to the shed being opened. The family wanted out.

Bigelow bought the ranch, installed a team of scientists and investigators, and began a long-term surveillance and investigation. The team from the National Institute for Discovery Science began to experience a similar range of weird events. Most of those events remained private until the 2005 publication of Hunt for the Skinwalker, a book by Kelleher and Knapp. The legend of Skinwalker Ranch was born, igniting considerable media attention, along with waves of trespassers, vandals, and uninvited amateur paranormal investigators.

“It was always one step ahead of us,” Bigelow told Knapp in his very first on-camera interview. The businessman referred to the events on the ranch as “displays” and “performances.” 

Few people had more experience with the phenomenon on the ranch than Jean Dietz. In 1999, Jean and her husband Richard were hired by Bigelow to serve as on-site caretakers for the ranch, which meant moving into the small house in what is known as Homestead 1. The Dietz’s were 24/7 residents of the ranch for 19 years. Because they had signed a strict non-disclosure agreement with Bigelow, the husband and wife have never spoken publicly about their experiences until Jean Dietz shared some with Knapp in January 2020.

At what point did the duo start noticing strange phenomena? “Well, pretty much right away,” Dietz commented matter-of-factly. She recalled hearing the sounds of heavy machinery under their feet and metallic noises coming from underground. Jean says she was startled a few times by the sounds of someone walking around in the house, even though she was the only one present. At one point, she encountered the wispy specter of a long-dead relative. On many nights, she had her husband were overwhelmed by powerful odors in the house, sometimes musky, sometimes smoky.

“I’d be watching TV and it was like somebody was smoking a cigarette. I used to smoke many years ago and it would just choke me,” she recalled. “The smell was really close like someone was blowing it in my face. I jumped up and went to the other room—nothing there.”

She says they started seeing orbs of light in the night sky, including a huge object shaped like a light bulb that traveled parallel to some nearby power lines. One of Jean’s regular duties for NIDS after 2002 was to scan the videotapes that were recorded by surveillance cameras the night before. When items of interest appeared on the tapes, she would alert the NIDS team.

“There was always something in the sky. Always,” she stated.

Like the Gorman family before them, the Dietz’s felt they were always under some sort of surveillance. She told Knapp that she had an encounter with a humanoid form that was seemingly shielded from view by an opaque camouflage system.

“You could see his light. Like you could see a human form and you could see this tiny light and it was running away because it was really early in the morning.”

The Dietz’s remained on the property for a few years after Bigelow sold the ranch to Utah real estate tycoon Brandon Fugal in 2016. The decision to sell the property after 20 years of ownership and the oversight of two different investigations (NIDS and BAASS) wasn’t that difficult for Bigelow. He wanted to focus his energy and finances on Bigelow Aerospace projects.

“I was very disturbed toward the end because of something that happened to some of the government people,” Bigelow said in an interview with George Knapp in 2021. “Everybody took things home with them; I took things to my house, things happened to my wife and to me. Everybody took things home. We all did, but we didn’t know it was like gonna be kind of permanent. We didn’t know that this going to stay with you for maybe years and years or rest of your life. Who knows? And it’s not that it happened on the ranch, it was when they left the ranch, I do say hitchhikers. And these are government people and it affected them in very dramatic ways. Very dramatic ways.”

Bigelow has also admitted the mystery of the ranch was frustrating in that it provided tantalizing glimpses of strange phenomena and of its own intelligence but it defied all attempts made by NIDS and BAASS to open some form of communication or to even define what was underway, or why. 

“It gets frustrating,” Bigelow said, “because you have so many of these things happen. And where is it leading? What are you supposed to make of it? You know, after a while . . . what is the point here?”

In spite of the unsettling things that had happened during his stewardship of the ranch, Bigelow was never going to simply unload the property on some unsuspecting buyer. The name Brandon Fugal was suggested to Bigelow. And he became convinced that Fugal would not only take care of the ranch but might be willing to invest money in a continuation of the previous investigations.

“I bought the property as a skeptic, as someone who had never seen a UFO or a ghost or orb or anything of the sort,” Fugal told an interviewer in 2021. “And I fully expected that there would be a, you know, a 95% chance of the natural prosaic explanation for what had been reported for decades.”

But that isn’t how things worked out for Fugal and his team. As soon as the sale of the ranch was completed in the spring of 2016, Fugal started pumping money into the property, upgraded the video surveillance system on the ranch, hired a new team of onsite manages and investigators, and set about trying to figure out if the legends and lore were true. Almost immediately, unusual activity on the property spiked.

“People ask me all the time whether I am now a believer based on what we have seen and recorded during my ownership of the ranch,” says Fugal to Den of Geek.6 “The honest, most direct answer I can provide is that I am not a believer. I am an ‘experiencer.’ I know for a fact that it is real and have witnessed with my own eyes, with other credible witnesses at my side, what can only be described as daylight sightings of exotic craft over Skinwalker Ranch.”

Among the phenomena Fugal has seen with his own eyes was a “40 to 50-foot long silver, grayish disc-like object that performed maneuvers that were stunning and defy conventional observation.” It was a daylight sighting of an object reported by multiple witnesses.6

As happened during the NIDS and BAASS years, Fugal’s team was perplexed by electronic abnormalities. Batteries died. Equipment malfunctioned. Cameras shut down. Compasses spun around in circles. The team detected radiation in parts of the ranch, and some of the team members have experienced serious physical effects from radiation exposure, but hours or days later, when the radiation was no longer detectable.

“It messes with electronics. I mean, until you experience that, it’s very easy to laugh it off or to be skeptical,” Fugal remarked during another interview. “But even the third-party engineers, the experts that we brought on the property, most of which have been complete skeptics, leave with a completely different perspective, and experience their equipment not only malfunctioning but in some cases being completely damaged. And for no reason that they can actually pinpoint, that can be easily explained.”

In 2019, Fugal began speaking with the History Channel about a proposed television series. The program, The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch, finished its second full season in 2021 and has the green light for a third season after bringing the story of the ranch to a new and expanded audience. For the series, History Channel brought a face familiar to its viewers. Astrophysicist Dr. Travis Taylor was, like Fugal, highly skeptical about claimed paranormal activity on the ranch. That is no longer the case. Dr. Taylor is one of the people who was exposed to and injured by radiation from an unknown source. He is also no longer skeptical about the alleged “hitchhiker effect.” 

“We don’t like to talk about the hitchhiker too much because everybody’s afraid it’s going to trigger it or something,” Taylor told Den of Geek.6 “I have several colleagues that were putting instruments out to measure things at their house, as well as at the ranch. And we’re measuring simultaneous events occurring at both places that may be a thousand miles apart.” 

To date, no one has figured out what is responsible for the unusual activity at Skinwalker Ranch and throughout much of the Uinta Basin. The people who’ve spent their lives in the area are well aware that something unusual has been unfolding there for decades, maybe longer, and do not need scientists to convince them that it is real. Three scientific investigations have thus far failed to explain most of the incidents and sightings that have been reported over the years, so the mysteries persist.
